0,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",Positive
1,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.

Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.

It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.

Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).

I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",Positive
2,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.",Neutral
3,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",Neutral
4,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.

this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",Positive
5,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.",Neutral

7,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting. To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.",Positive
8,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.",Positive
9,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.",Neutral
10,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime",Negative
11,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",Negative
12,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.",Positive
13,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.

Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.

Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.

Film of the year? Nope.",Positive

15,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.

I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.

Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.

Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",Negative
16,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.

I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.

this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.

I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.

Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.

I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG

This movie is bang average and way overhyped.

phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.

I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.

there is a real world out there.",Positive

20,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh.",Positive
21,"The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity"" & Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime. Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking. The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10. Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.",Positive
22,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",Positive
23,,Neutral
24,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.",Positive
25,"Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.

I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.

First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.

But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.

There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.

Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.

I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.

I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",Positive
26,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.",Positive
27,"The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction....

....the film is kinda boring.

It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.

The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it.",Negative
28,"The origins of a Monster.

If you see one film this year, please see The Joker. It does seem that we are getting constant remakes and origins films, but this is remarkable, I think people are fed up of both mentioned categories because many of the movies we're presented with haven't come up to scratch. The Joker however is phenomenal, the best film I've seen in the cinema for quite some time. I was enthralled from start to finish. The story is fantastic, the writing thoughtful and intelligent.

Joaquin Phoenix, what can you say, it's a master class performance from him, he injects everything needed into the part, to make it chilling, sad and menacing. No wonder the awards are flowing.

I genuinely cannot remember the last time I left a cinema feeling so rewarded by a film.

Incredible. 10/10",Positive

32,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.

If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.",Positive

34,"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).

This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.",Negative

36,"In Gotham City, the clown and aspirant comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an outcast mentally disturbed man that lives with his deranged mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). When the social service office that attends him is shutdown, Arthur stops his medication and the abusive society drives him crazier to a criminal life.

""Joker"" is a dark and depressive film that discloses a dramatic version of the Joker´s origin. Joaquin Phoenix has a top-notch performance in the role of a mentally disturbed man disregarded by the society with a nervous twitch. His acting makes the viewer recalls and compares with Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"", the best so far. The dark and gruesome cinematography shows a dirty Gotham City with the garbage collector strike. The music score is also spectacular with hits from the 70´s and 80´s. My vote is seven.

38,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.",Neutral
39,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.

I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.

Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing",Positive

41,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.

Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.

The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.

Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.

In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.

But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.",Neutral
42,"After Heath Ledger's version of the Joker in the hugely popular Christopher Nolan Batman movies it was difficult to see how Joker could be a success.

But quite simply this is one of the best films I've ever seen.

I've loved many of Todd Phillips' comedies such as Road Trip, Old School and The Hangover, but I would have never thought he was capable of writing and directing a movie like Joker.

It's pretty uncomfortable viewing for the most part. It's almost like a documentary following someone's mental health journey as they spiral into depression and a life of crime.

The script, music and cinematography are all incredible and Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most deserved Oscar winners I've ever seen. He's an incredible actor. Truly mesmerising.

Robert De Niro also deserves a special mention for one of his best performances for a long time.

If you haven't seen this movie you have to watch it! It doesn't matter if you're not a Batman or comic book fan as it also holds up as a standalone movie.

I hope Todd Phillips continues on this path and look forward to his next movie.",Positive

I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated.",Neutral
52,"The whole point of this movie is to bring attention to mental illness (I'll do you one better and name a bigger issue than mental illness that the film barely focuses on; the lack of quality mental healthcare) but the film completely discredits its own message with a one dimensional depiction of most of the world and characters that inhabit it. It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs.",Negative
53,"Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.

""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States.""",Positive
54,"Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.

But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.

Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a ""thrill park ride"". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie",Negative
55,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and in an endless sea of mediocre cape flicks released every year, the Joker obviously looks like a masterpiece by comparison.

The movie itself is not as memorable or clever as the fanboys claim it is, but it still mesmerizes me the passionate reactions everyone seems to have about the Joker, with some acting as if this was some sort of cinematic Antichrist (Similar to the way in which a lot of people reacted to the mere existence of movies like the Da Vinci Code or the Last Temptation of the Christ back then) claiming it would definitely inspire acts of violence.

I can't help but find ironic how a movie that demonizes the rich (To be fair, they totally deserve to be demonized) still manages to get lot of love from the same kind of reactionaries that would be against billionaires paying higher taxes, and also a lot of love from people who worship Trump as a god (Despite the fact that Trump and his cronies are very close in personality to the trio of rich jerks that harass Arthur in the subway than Thomas Wayne-Who, by the way, isn't exactly portrayed very sympathetically either)

Must be a consequence of these clueless reviews and hot takes made by equally clueless reviewers that only focus in the fact that the main character is Caucasian and male, and not in the fact that he is poor and suffering from bad (physical and mental) health, despite the fact the movie clearly shows he is anything but privileged. And also, despite the fact the events from this movie are told from the perspective of Arthur Fleck, that doesn't mean the movie ""glorifies"" his behavior, nor is he portrayed as a hero (Also remember that plenty of scenes made very clear he is pretty delusional, so his perspective of the events is ambiguous at best, but it seems that modern audiences have become allergic to any form of ambiguity for some reason)

Sometimes I wonder why the Batman-related media seems to have such bizarre effect on people. It's the Dark Knight all over again, a decent movie treated as the best thing since sliced bread. And while I admit that while this is better than anything from the MCU, I also think that kind of soulless corporate garbage shouldn't be the measure of quality for anything.",Positive
56,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!

Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.

Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.

My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.

Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.

58,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.",Positive
59,"Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down.",Negative

63,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10",Positive

Yes, Joaquin Phoenix, who has always been a veritable bastion of talent, was masterful in the role. Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.

What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge.",Positive

70,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.

The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.

Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.

Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.

Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.

Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).

The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.",Neutral
71,"Not sure what kind of message this movie is supposed to send. Or is it supposed to be just fun, because it's not. I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves. I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche.

76,"A deep scan of reviews has fans that can understand depression become overwhelmed with empathy. There is a reason for everything, and understanding the context of a nostalgic character like the joker is what works.

There was not a faithfulness to the scenes in Batman begins. Police chief introduces him during the outro as someone fairly unknown not a state wide celeb as played out in this film, that break in story continuity ruins it for me.

Likewise the reinterpretation of Mr Wayne as something he never was. This takes away from the moral clarity of the pending superhero Batman.

The greed narrative feels like its something that was force fed without rhyme or reason. While the joker had a substantial arc, the sub plots did not.

Nostalgia is what brings the film to life, there is not many ways to not make money from iconic characters, this film should have been attempted years ago!

Over the years Hollywood actors have been applauded for playing villians which is the easiest character study of them all. Whats hard is being protector of the realm without it feeling preachy or cheesy. These roles get a natural upscaling.

The main plot element of inviting Arthur onto the talk show was not convincing, the stand up performance was not in the genre of 'so bad its good' his first vision from the audience defending his mother was however powerful and well written.

A cameo for Alfred the butler would have been special and really pulled us back into the story.

The ways this film was lauded in its first week was ridiculous, it does drag in many places over the 2hr hour screening.

All the theatrical trailers were an 8 so many of us expected more. To say this is a better production than Batman Begins is shocking.

The difficult reality to bare in this over hyped rating and cultural reality is many people in our age really feel like this and are on the verge of rioting after life takes its toll.

The broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes is a great story that can be told a million ways, this was not executed well.

The dream sequences worked well but the device was still not as good as Heath Ledgers raw portrayal of a psychopathic megalomaniac and the cinematography of Nolan in related films.

Simple plot failures like the police not being able to catch up with Arthur who was not trying to be careful was disappointing and took me right out of the story.

A good ensemble of actors can't save a bad script, why was this rushed to production? Something as important as Batman origin stories need much more careful work. I believe over time this score must average out and down.

Was this an homage to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King of Comedy"" apparently not. The opportunity for genuine franchise building was surprisingly tossed away and will be hard to repair.

Critics who use the word 'masterpiece' and 'groundbreaking' need to have a long hard look at themselves, their surroundings and the education that they all seem to share. There is F all diversity in this mob who keep playing us.",Neutral

78,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.

They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.

If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did.",Positive
79,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.

In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.

Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.

And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.

That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year.",Neutral

Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.

However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.

This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance.",Positive

When a 'major' movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers - it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We've already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past. Even the dark, sleazy settings don't invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three.

Then there's the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those 'gangster- obsessed' Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use.

If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you'll get a bellyful - otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that's reducing the USA to a decaying mess.

91,"No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit. The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one). The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't. The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker. Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory.

I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!",Neutral
100,"This movie rips off other movies, doesn't have any redeeming value, and even implies Bruce Wayne is the father of the Joker? What kind of joke is this? Not a DC movie, not an origins story. Just the work of some hack who stole ideas from Scorsese, and tries to make a dangerous, ill man into some kind of folk hero. Unfortunately Joaquim Phoenix just overacts in this one. And he's in literally every single scene in this movie, so it becomes very tiresome to watch. Crap.",Negative
101,"Make everyone into pricks and jerks towards a clown because he'll become one of the deadliest batman villains of all time.

Bedaaaaboring!

From the getgo everyone was being jerks. That's not the main problem. It's just the movie lacked dept. People are jerks to Arthur and he reacts. People are jerks and Arthur reacts. That was the whole movie.

Everyone that Arthur interacts with are pricks to him. With the exception to the sick children there was not one person that had a positive relationship with Arthur.

This movie is evidence that anyone can make a billion dollar movie as of 2019.

Lastly the movie never really starts. Once the movie gets interesting. The credits roll.",Negative
102,"First of all amidst all chaos i could appreciate the brilliance in Joaquin Phoenix's acting. He has nailed what most of the current lot of actors would not even think of reaching. I can specifically see three different personalities inside his role. He did an amazing job on all three.

Secondly , A film is not all about how well the lead actor performs and binds to his role. It should have a sound cinematography and Script. Joker is seriously do not have a story to relate for the viewers. In the entire film it was just searching for a story or a message to relate for the viewer. Script is just touching here and there but never had a solid flow or emotions attached to it. That is why I never felt sorry or sad about JOKER or the underprivileged people. I was just having zero emotions to the movement he started or for the things he had done in the film.

I would sight this film as a classic example for a failed script which always tried to deliver best scenes for the lead actor. In one aspect Joaquin actually kills all other what would be good factors which would have contributed to overall success of the film. All scenes are directed to make JOKER shine hence the story and the character build up of the rest has been clearly ignored and dumped.

This film can win the award for the best actor in a leading role but will not even nominate for any other categories. What did that tell you ? Success of the film or a failure ? It is up to you to decide.

I would remind you of ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994 . Tom Hanks played a similar role and all the attention was on to him. But it had a very heartwarming and a complex story to tell. Rest of the cast had a role to play in the story. All in all Tom Hanks did not do justice for him but for the entire film. Film ended winning 6 Oscars in 1995 competing with the likes of Shawshank Redemption/ Pulp Fiction.",Negative
103,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)",Neutral
104,"This film is undeserving of the praise it received. Boring and uninteresting in every imaginable way. A failed celebration of derangement culminating in the end with an act of cowardice. There was no depth, only subcutaneous attempts at shock. It was predictable and boring.",Negative

108,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.

I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.

If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.

Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director.",Positive
109,"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time",Neutral
110,"Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.

Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.

Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.

A performance and film that one will not easily forget.",Positive

112,"This is not an underdog antihero story, if that's what you were expecting. This movie makes no attempt (as so many other movies do these days) to put a positive spin on a villain or invert morality to make its protagonist secretly good or make the audience root for him. Despite this, the film elicits empathy for the broken man it holds in its spotlight in the same way one might feel empathy for a diseased, mistreated, but ultimately unsalvageable dog. In the end, your heart goes out to him, but you still feel like someone should put him down, and that's exactly how one ought to feel for one of Gotham's most well known psychopaths.",Neutral

I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.",Positive
115,I like Joakin Phoenix but his performance wasn't Oscar worth like Heath Ledger! The movie wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad but this writer turned this into a slow joke with this music! I can see why people got upset about the mental ill aspect of this movie but a person with a mental illness pushed to the edge! It didn't stink but it could've been better and I wish it had been!,Neutral
116,"This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.

It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson's This isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman",Positive
117,"Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.

Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.

Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.

It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.

Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.

From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.

For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.

As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.

It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.

While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.

Final Say -

Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.

118,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end.",Positive
119,What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.,Positive
120,"Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.

This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.

Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.

I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.

There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10",Positive
121,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.

Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.

When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?

Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!",Positive

I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great. Overall Iâ€™m glad I got this because I really needed to upgrade my iPhone 8.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else.

Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ðŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .

This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly!  Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also.  I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!

So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and itâ€™s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition thatâ€™s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. Theyâ€™re great.

I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!

I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great.

I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasnâ€™t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand.

After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!

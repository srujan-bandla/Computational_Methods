We have here Bruce Teruo Kaji and Dana Hoshide is on the video camera, and I will be interviewing and my name is Martha Nakagawa. And Bruce, this is our second session with you. I think the last time we ended was you and Kiyo Maruyama opened a Little Tokyo office and during, that was during the day, and then you started to teach night classes at East L.A. College, and then in between you were sneaking visits with Frances Tashiro. Now, can you tell us, you, you were coming and visiting her at her parents' house, how was their reception of you?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2967,"Well, when I was there her father was busy or ill. He was down with a problem of, what is it, not pneumonia, but tuberculosis, and he was confined to a rest home, so he was not at his home at the time I was teaching. And I don't know how soon after that he passed away, but as we were meeting with Frances and getting to know her better, then we waited a year after he passed away before we got married. So he was in pretty bad shape. He was not at home. He was in a sanitarium. But that was the story of my visiting. Her mother was very cordial and I didn't stay too long; I just dropped in and paid my respects on the way to teach, and I would not drop in after teaching. I would go straight home, so it was just, during the days I would teach I would drop in. Not every day.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And we had a little reception at the church and we had our friends come in and after the ceremony they had a reception in the reception area, and it was not a big wedding.

2976,"Now, when you got married did you live with Frances's mother or did you go, did you move into Gardena?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2977,"Well Frances's mother owned a four-plex right next to her residence at 433 South Boyle, I think, and one of the units opened up, so Frances and I moved into one of the apartments there for a while. We stayed there and it was obvious that we were gonna have a family, so we decided we'd better move into a home and found a place in Gardena to buy, so we moved out of the place next to her mother and, on 5th Street, and went over to 14708 South -- no, it was on Compton Boulevard, at that time, in Gardena. It was a three bedroom house on Compton Boulevard, yeah.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2978,"Now, before you moved into Gardena and you were living in the complex that Mrs. Tashiro owned, you were also active with the International Institute, which was very close to that house. Can you tell us what the International Institute was and what they did? Oh, and then you also became their first Japanese American board member, if I remember correctly. Can you tell us a little bit about the International Institute?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2979,"Well, the International Institute was a red feather agency, community chest agency, and dealt with the foreign people who were trying to get adjusted to the life in the United States, and so they were helping all kinds of different ethnic groups, the, the French group, there were, I'm pretty sure German, Japanese and Chinese and Filipino. And Miss Esther Bartlett was the director, and she also encouraged young people, so the Japanese Americans returning back to Los Angeles area, she helped them by opening up the Institute for them to have meetings and dances. And so the Niseis took advantage of that because we had nothing, and when the girl clubs used to sponsor dance the boys would come over and they would go over to the Institute and have the privilege of using the facilities. That was very, very gracious, gracious of her. She was a real friend.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2980,"Now, during the 1950s there was a uranium rush, and that's very similar to the gold rush, and you folks also got into this. Can you share with us your experience trying to find uranium?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2981,"Well, Kiyo Maruyama and I were partners in accounting and we were approached by some of the Manzanar Friends who said there was a group of miners or prospectors who were looking for getting some backing. They were going to go to Arizona to look for uranium, and being poor and thought maybe if it would be a lucky strike, that would be very fortuitous, so Kiyo and I called some friends together to see if they, they would back this group from Pasadena, couple of miners. And they didn't need much money, so we formed a partnership and backed them up for their operation. They had a truck, they had the maps, they had the know how, where to go, and Arizona is one of the richest areas as far as minerals are concerned. There was a federal depot where they stored strategic ores at Wenden, Arizona, and people there would mine different kinds of strategic ores, could then take them over to Wenden and report 'em and get 'em weighed, assayed, and later on the federal government, if it was assayable and worthwhile they would be paid from the San Francisco office. So we were looking for the right kind of things, but the only thing that they were able to find that was mineable was manganese, and manganese came in, it'd be known as seams, and the seams would be, from the top you could find the seam and it would go down, so we had to find miners who would work at it, physical pick and shovel, and there weren't many people out there looking for jobs, but there were ex-miners and people who were out of jobs looking for something. And so they were able to find people to go and work and mine and dig out the manganese, and then they would take the rich manganese that was part of the seam, the black seam, and put it aside and later on mix it so that you would have the weight and not give away all the good stuff, balance it out and then deliver it to the depot. And then the depot would take the product that you would deliver and they would then assay it and then report to San Francisco what the property that you turned in was worth and they would send you a check. With the check, that would give us more money to pay salary, still looking for the big gold mine. [Laughs]",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2982,"was a experience that I thought was a little... well, I think being young, you're willing to try it, but they said what if someone, you're delivering cash because the miners don't have checking accounts over there. All they do is receive cash. You can't give 'em a check because they don't have a bank account. The only thing they know is, ""Give me cash and I can use that."" So we would have to, well I forget, once a month drive over to the site where they were mining and deliver cash to them. We would have the figure for the amount we would pay them, and so Kiyo and I would figure what it would come to in cash and make an envelope for the cash, and for the number of employees, usually it's no more than four or five, make envelopes and put the money in, and I would usually drive it out to the site. You'd get off the regular road and then you take the path up to the campsite. There's nobody around. Somebody says, ""Well, what if someone knew you were comin' up with the cash?"" I says, ""Yeah, that's pretty bad."" Nothing happened. We drove up there once a month and we gave 'em the envelope and they opened it up, and before they do that they would have to sign, and a lot of 'em would sign, would only sign an X because they didn't know how to sign their names. They were not educated, or they didn't have the know-how how to... It, it was an experience to know how some people lived, and they promptly found a place to spend it. It was hard to find them over the weekend. They're out there boozin' it up. [Laughs] But that's life out there in the Arizona mines. So that was an experience, I think, that taught me a little bit about how other people live and how other people are educated or non-educated, and how people are looking for the big one. Everybody's looking for the gold mine or whatever. Taught us a lesson, Kiyo and I, that nothing is easy. So we stuck to accounting.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2985,"We were still looking for investments. I think as accountants, we did set up a group that met once a month, of investment-oriented accountants, and they used to meet in Gardena, at my office, and we had about ten members, and each of us brought a check. Our meetings, we went out to eat Chinese food, and after that we would go to the office and have a little meeting, and each one would bring in a check for, I think it was a hundred dollars. And so we would try to build up our cash reserves, and we decided that our best bet would be to go into real estate, and so we kept doing that for a while and it turned out that one of our investments was to purchase land in Colorado. Taul Watanabe, my brother-in-law, was starting savings and loans, like merit savings and then guild savings up in Sacramento, and he went to Denver and started another savings and loan there, and while he was there he met some attorneys and he himself was a graduate of, of the university in Colorado in law, and he heard of some land that's available for investment going south towards the air force academy. And so some of the attorneys that he was involved with knew of landowners along the road, along the highway, so we started quarrying land in Colorado. And we wound up with, I think all told we wound up with about three thousand acres, and with different ownerships. Ours was a little piece, but as time went on and we kept making payments on it, and it came to a time when development started coming in, population started increasing, and speculators were coming in to buy land ahead of development, so we were offered a pretty good price for our land that we had specked on and so our accountants group decided to sell. And so after we sold it and got cash, then the question was, what are we gonna do? Are we going to reinvest it or spend it?

2987,"we decided to divide the money and some of us decided to take a trip that we would never ever think of doing, and so we contracted for most of the investors to go on this trip overseas and to go on this Mediterranean trip and we'd go visit the Greek Islands. And so we did, and it was a fascinating trip that our wives and our associates would never forget. We would never even think of doing anything like that, but it was a one-time opportunity, and so we all enjoyed this ship in the Mediterranean, going from island to island, finding out about the old populations and eventually winding up in such places as the, all the Greek Islands that we know of, and I went to the, Egypt and also to Israel and visited the place where Christ was born, and, and it was an eye-opener. And my wife got on a camel outside of the Cheops, the pyramid, and she wouldn't answer the, the camel trainer. He says, ""Madam, I am having a difficult time,"" and he's trying to get some baksheesh, a little tip, but knowing my wife, she wasn't about to give any baksheesh, so she wouldn't say a word. But he wasn't gonna give up either, so we came to a time where everybody was to get off and so he's still talking to her, ""Madam, I would like to have a little donation, baksheesh."" But she wouldn't answer, so he took her around again and she still wouldn't talk. He finally let her off, but he was so disappointed. She's, I think, the only customer that never tipped him. [Laughs] I didn't know she had such a stubborn streak, but that's, you find out in life as life goes on. But they were all looking for tips because when we went to visit the pyramids, people are walking up to the pyramid and going into the pyramid, and the opening is much smaller because back when they built it, they weren't very tall, so everything that was built was built to their size and so you had to hunch down to get into the, the, I guess it's a hallway to go all the way to the main room where they buried the famous people. And so everyone nowadays is much taller, bigger, but the Egyptians were waiting there and trying to get people together to lead 'em into the pyramid, into the inner room, chambers and then out and then collect some money, but a lot of the people, they wouldn't, they wouldn't listen. They would just go out on their own and they were fairly frustrated because, like me, I just went ahead and he's chasing me, then he thought about all the people waiting in the back so he went back. By the time he went back and got them going I had visited the chamber and then went out by another exit. But that was an experience because you find that everywhere you go, especially in Egypt, and if you had to go to the restroom, there's a lady sitting there at the door and you have to pay to get in. If you want other services you have to pay, so that's the way it was.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

We wouldn't have ever even thought of going overseas if it weren't for that fortuitous sale of real estate that all of a sudden came in, and some of the people kept the money. They didn't want to go on a trip. That's alright. But for us, having done that, I never regretted it and my wife never regretted it, and a lot of people says, we go to church and people say, ""Well, one of these days I'm gonna go and visit Israel, find out where Christ was born."" ""Oh, we've been there."" [Laughs] Yeah, when they talk about the different places, yeah, we did visit, and it became more real in terms of the, the street where Christ carried the cross, you go, walk right by it and they say this is that particular street, and find the place where he was born.

Well, it was a piece of land that was being used by Harvey Chapman, who was a golf pro, and he was using that as a place where people could hit golf balls, a driving range. And it was located on Western Avenue near Compton Boulevard, and so he didn't own the land, but we saw it as an opportunity to buy it and develop a shopping center. I didn't have the foresight for that. Taul Watanabe did. He was a, he had a lot of, I would say, ideas of how to make money, and one of 'em was building the shopping for the Japanese American community, and so he bought the land and got... the local people in Gardena had several service clubs, and the service clubs that were the most popular were the Lions Club International and the Kiwanis Club, and there was also some others, but those were the two main, main ones. And so the Lions Club was the largest, and so with the Lions Club he had a lot of connections and he thought that maybe we could interest some of the people in town to invest, but they weren't interested in development. We then organized a home state investment company, a corporation to raise money, to buy the land and to develop it, so it took a little while, but we were able successfully to get local people to invest money. We built a shopping center and it had a market, it had an Oriental gift shop, a restaurant, Kyoto Sukiyaki upstairs, a cleaners, a baker, appliance store, a liquor store and a supermarket and some other stores in between. But the fellows that operated the supermarkets, Taul was able to talk to people in Sacramento that were operating a market and asked them, ""Are you interested in opening a market in Gardena?"" And so they had several brothers, Kunibe brothers, and so they came down and looked at the site and they thought, since there was a good community of Japanese Americans, that this would be a good site, so they opened a Town & Country market. What was the name? I forget the name of the market they opened up, but they staffed it, brought the Kunibe brothers down. Henry came down and Tom came down and George (Orite) also, a partner, came down, and they brought a butcher down and opened a meat department, and a older brother who was a pharmacist opened up the drugstore. So between the Kunibes and Taul Watanabe and his connections, we opened up a shopping center that had all the, all the stores were filled up when we opened up. People were interested in getting into business. We were successful in managing the Town & Country, which I wound up managing the shopping center and the corporation kept it and operated it and declared dividends every year until we decided to sell it, which we did to some investors from Los Angeles.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

I'll get the checks and then you credit all these people and keep a running account of what people owe, and so I had access to most of the businessmen who were involved in Gardena, so as they got my notices and got to talk to them, they got to know me, I got to know them, and so my contact with them was very, very personal, and then they got to talk to me and found out that, yeah, I'm Japanese American, but I'll keep track of your records.

I don't know if was, what kind of shoes he sold, but he was, anyway, it was one of the name brand shoes he sold. He was city treasurer. He decided to run for (city) council, so when he gave that up, then the office for city treasurer opened up, and since I was in accounting I says what's involved in being city treasurer and talk (to) Firstman (and) he says, ""Oh, you don't have to worry. The city staff takes care of most of the investing the money and you have to sign the various things that city requires the city treasurer to sign and you get a salary."" I said that sounds good, so I decided to run. Turns out that (running for city treasurer) office I called, most of the people that had any money among the JAs were Issei, Yonemura-san, Fuji-san, they were all nursery men, and I called 'em up to my office and I says, ""I want to run for city treasurer, and so when I do..."" They said, ""Oh, sou desu ka."" ""Well, in order to run I have to have a campaign and I have to send literature out and it costs a little money. So Mr. Kamiya and Yonemura-san, onegai shimasu."" That's the first time they were approached on any kind of money for votes. As it turned out, at that time, I had a budget of about eighteen hundred dollars for my campaign and I didn't really have to spend that much because there was a group in a new section in Gardena, Holly Park, and new couples were moving in there from Los Angeles, and this one lady came and she was a reporter from the Holly Park area. She came to interview me because I was running for city treasurer, and I got to meet her. We went out for coffee and she got excited about my running, and she said, ""Well, you have the proper background."" She says, ""I can see the fellow that now, coming in to run against you is not a CPA. He's only a public accountant."" So Sid Lemberger is a public accountant that wanted to run for city treasurer, but he had been in town a long time, so people knew Sid. They knew very little bit about me, but it turns out that she was a reporter for the new tract area, Holly Park. Unbeknownst to me, some of the people that moved into Holly Park were Roosevelt (High School) people from East L.A., the Jewish kids that I knew. They knew about me from Roosevelt, so it turns out that was a hidden asset, and when I asked people to support me... I had a budget of eighteen hundred dollars, and my whole budget was spent on sending penny postcards out. At that time a postcard was only one cent, and so you'd type the addresses and, where you vote, and so the penny postcard was my contact to the public, sent it out to the Japanese Americans, and it was no contest. I won. It turns out between the Holly Park people and the Japanese Americans and the power of those, the one-cent postcard, yeah, we were, we were elected as city treasurer.

They only had commercial banks, so they, however, had the clout from the standpoint of capital. We were just coming back into society, trying to get buoyant, trying to make some money and trying to get established, so the banks really didn't have to fear us, but they, they were adjusting to the new things that were comin' up. We were primarily into real estate, and the commercial banks did everything. They made personal loans, they made commercial loans, they made real estate loans.

3045,"Yeah, Reuben, and (his) assistant was Jim (Yoshinaga), would come down and explain what he had in mind. As the meeting opened up and people were being informed by Reuben, he says that Little Tokyo has an opportunity to develop a master plan if they want to redevelop the area. It would be better for them to have a master plan, to get it approved by the city so then they could go ahead and do what they planned to do in an organized manner. And everybody thought that would be a good idea. And I says, ""The first time anybody's approached us from the city hall, and up to now they took parts of Little Tokyo away from us and they really haven't helped us. They chased us out of the, here, not the city but the government and we're trying to come back and reestablish it."" So there was a consensus that we ought to go ahead, so then we formed the Little Tokyo Redevelopment Association and we got Tets Nakamura, the attorney, to form it and he formed a nonprofit corporation and the membership made up of property owners and businessmen to contribute funds so we could then develop a master plan for Little Tokyo. And so I was elected as a chairman for that effort and we got started, and we were fortunate enough to have people who were interested. We had Mr. Uyeda, of Ueda Five and Dime (store). We had the chamber of commerce people that were interested because that would bring more business and their association would prosper. There were others that felt that it was time for us to do something so the city would not take more property away from us, and so we formed a nonprofit corporation (...) by Tets Nakamura, the attorney, and got it formed and got the membership of property owners and businesses to join and assembled enough money to put together a master plan to submit to the city planning commission. Mr. Lovret and Jim Yoshinaga were very instrumental in helping us and Tom Kamei, the structural engineer, he helped us investigate all the buildings for structural strength, and Tosh Terusawa and everyone in the community was really very positive about preserving Little Tokyo. And so we got the plan put together, submitted to the city planning. The city planning approved it, then it went to the city council.

3046,"Well, I don't know about how I got him to, to really help us, but he was a very outgoing person and one day I heard that he and his, his wife were headed for Hawaii, and I had some contacts in Gardena with Frank Yamamoto, who was selling lots on the Big Island, lots in the aftermath of the lava. He was selling lava rock, but he was selling and people were buying. It was very cheap. It was cheap because no one else was buying. But he was selling that in Gardena and I got to know Frank, and he moved back to Hawaii after he sold all the lots, and so I got to know him and since he was going to Hawaii, I didn't know anybody else except Frank. So I called Frank, I says, ""Frank, you won't believe this, but I need your help. I'm not gonna ask for money. If you spend money for me I will reimburse you, but I have this councilman coming over with his wife for their first time in Hawaii."" I says, ""Could you take care of him?"" He says, ""Oh yeah, I'll take care of him."" And when councilman landed there I says you can't mistake who he is. He's gonna be the only black person with his wife who's a, is rotund. [Laughs] Teresa. And he took care of them and they had such a fabulous time. Frank took them around and they couldn't believe Hawaii was the way it was, and it was mixed 'cause the Hawaiians were dark also and there was no discrimination, and they came back just bubbling. And he called me on the phone, he says, ""Hey, Bruce."" He says, ""I had a good time. Teresa had a great time."" Says, ""I don't how to thank you."" I says, ""You don't have to thank me, I'm just glad you had a good time."" And so he naturally was supporting everything we did. Eventually he paid back Frank, because I think the following year Los Angeles was hosting the Olympics and he called Frank and he says, ""Frank, come over here."" He says, ""Bring your wife."" He says, ""I got tickets for you for the Olympics,"" through his connection. And he didn't bring his wife but he brought a friend and they had tickets to everything of the Olympics, and I couldn't see Frank because he was too busy. But that was a payback because Gil was so appreciative. But through that connection, everything that I asked him to do, he was very cooperative, and also he knew that Little Tokyo needed help and since it was in his district he was more than willing to go out and do the things for us.

I didn't know how bad it was until I got there, but it turned out that it was at a point where it had to be sold and in order to do so we had to form a new corporation. So we were able to find some investors to come in and take it over, and in order to do so they formed a public corporation and sold stock and bought the old Gardena Savings. They says, ""We'll, we'll take it over, providing you stay and take care of the problems."" In order to get the thing resolved I stayed there until we got the savings and loan resolved with the regulators as well as found investors for the property, and the investors who came in then formed a public corporation and went public with the assets. They got rid of the problem assets and raised more capital. And one of the fellows that was with a new corporation from Century City I had just met, but his partner had developed a real estate corporation that developed apartments all over the state of California. And they were unique, really scientifically put together. They were apartment projects which were for married couples, and at the front of the development he had facilities to take care of children, babies and young people, not schooled, but you know. So people who were wanting to work and had young children could leave 'em -- they would have to pay, naturally, for the services, but at least they were then able to go out and find a job and work and bring some money in. They developed these homes or apartments with that kind of service and were successful in catering to the general public. They also developed other apartments up and down the coast. And they said, ""Well, if I take over, the troubled savings and loans assets that Gardena Savings had,"" says I could also manage the properties they had, so I had found some real estate developers to take care of the problem savings and loans that Merit, Gardena had made loans on apartments, most were in Orange County, fourplexes. Developers came in and built the fourplexes and they ran into problems. They couldn't rent 'em out, and so they had people who came in and rented, they couldn't collect, they chased 'em out, they damaged the property, all kinds of problems. Anyway, we got a crew together to go one by one and straighten these out, so we at last found some corporations that would take over the whole thing at a reduced price and got rid of 'em.

Can you share with us this, how you started?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3061,"Well, I think all along the GIs had started the idea of the museum, the 100th/442nd and MIS, and they put a photographic exhibit up at one of the county museums, which they had a big opening and had the county officials come and it was very popular during the opening, but after the opening no one would go over there to look at the exhibit. There's no follow up. It was there, but no publicity, very few people would go see it, so as a result of it after the term of months that were allowed for the exhibit to be on the county property they had to remove it. And so they took it off, out and put it over at the veterans' hall, but there was no one that would come, the public, so it's kind of languished. I really don't know what happened to all the pictures they had. It could be that we received 'em at the museum because no one else could use 'em. With the veterans the big problem was not only trying to satisfy their particular wishes and the 100th/442nd group led by Colonel Kim always wanted their own establishment. They wanted, he didn't want to be associated, from my understanding, with any other establishment. He just wanted the 100th/442nd. We got together with the MIS and the 100th/442nd and formed a corporation of both of 'em, but as far as Colonel Kim was concerned, that was his whole life, is the 100th/442nd. I don't blame him either. He did a great job. But the problem was finding a location and finding the money to do it, and so instead of staying with the Japanese American National Museum, which Merit Savings was the one that was pushing that all, all the way, he decided to go out on his own, and in doing so, although he got started with the Nishi Hongwanji project together, he didn't join in.

And you mentioned that Joseph's Menswear was next to your office, or was at one point, and you got to know Joseph Ito and his brother-in-law was Minoru Yamasaki, so how did this relationship with Minoru Yamasaki go?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3063,"Yeah, it's very interesting. When we were promoting the museum and Merit was the first one that was wanting to form a development which would include a museum, and we bought the property at First and Alameda. It was the former California Hardware, large brick institution. It had about, I don't know, about an acre and three quarters, went to Second Street, and we thought that would be ideal location for development to include a museum, and so I went and talked to the owner over there and says, ""You know, I don't know if you people are looking for new locations, but we would be interested in trying to work out something with you to buy this old building and tear it down and work out something for you to move to another location in a modern building."" And they took it up. So we finally made a deal with Merit and California Hardware where we bought a piece of property in the City of Commerce and agreed to build a building for them in exchange for their old property here, so we worked on an exchange agreement and they built the building and then we exchanged properties. Then we tore this building down. We found guano in there. You know what guano is?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

Couldn't find anybody and we just got rid of it. And the, some of the biggest rats in town. A real rat came out of that building across the floor. I don't know where it disappeared to. It was a big rat. [Laughs] We tore the building down and discovered not only bats but rats, and leveled it off and then paid for a study to be made to see what we could build and if the timing was right, so we had a study made to give us an idea if the timing was right. So the end result was that we were in a very, very slow period of our economics here in Los Angeles, and they said, ""This is not the time to try to start to build."" And so then the board decided, well, the timing wasn't right, we'd sell it. So we sold it to a local developer, what's his name? He got some money from his friends and advisors from overseas and, gee, I can't even think of his name. He and his dad bought, bought the property from us, and they've had that all along as a parking lot. And what was his name? He developed also the property at Second and San Pedro where Narumi was.

3071,"Yeah, I think so. So she was into collections about the Japanese American, and she knew the people from Northern Cal because she came from there, and so I had heard about her and we were in contact with Nancy, and when we were talking about starting the museum, since she was a contact originally for those pictures that were set up at the park I contacted her and she was the first person that we hired for the museum, and we hired her as a coordinator because we were looking for someone to head the whole thing up and we were looking for someone with more supervisory potential. And so we used to meet at Merit Savings in the board room on Saturdays with a committee of, to form the museum. And so we were interviewing people that were hired, we hired a firm to do a search nationwide and they tried, but there were no prospects. There were some that came over that had some experience, but nothing in terms of a large museum, so the Saturdays when we were interviewing people, we would meet at this board room of Merit Savings and then after the interview and the members of the committee at that time would decide whether or not to continue with them. And we didn't run across anybody. It turns out that, someone said there was a person who was managing a women's facility, medical facility in West Los Angeles, that she had started from scratch and that she might be the kind of person that could put a museum together. She had the ability to convince the county to finance her. So we sent out a couple of people to talk to her. She refused and we kept interviewing others. Finally they said, well, we better go back, see if we can get Irene again, and she finally agreed, so she came on board and we rented offices at 941 East Third Street, and that's where the museum started its office and also the JACL had its paper up there with Harry Honda at 91 East Third, East Third Street.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

So I'm wearing the same stuff I came with. But I got to know Minoru Yamasaki pretty well and we were just laughing about it.

We had a, after that he developed the plan and Nancy has a copy of what he prepared. It was a simple plan with buildings on the fringe and a possible museum in the middle of the courtyard. That was his off the hand, off, more or less first crack at what he thought we could do. And then we had the feasibility study, which came up with a negative, that it couldn't happen in this environment. Money was not available. Banks weren't loaning money. It would be impossible to pull a deal together, so we just dropped it. So that was the end of the idea for Merit.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

That became a very successful branch, then we went to Monterey Park, Monterey Park, then we went to, what was it, went to Orange County. Anyway, we had about four branches, and that brought in more savings. It also gave us more overhead, but, but what we thought was important was to get a good base of savers and start promoting so we could maybe either merge with someone and come out with a big organization. Being a small ethnic savings and loan is just, you have the odds against you, but eventually we sold out with a firm out of Orange County because we found out we can't grow anymore, and they took it over. They started to develop properties and he ran into problems, but anyway, we sold the property at First and Alameda to Al Taira and he kept it as a parking lot for a long time.

You had to preserve everything, so when we went ahead to do the building we had to remove everything, bring it down, redo it and then put it back up. We couldn't destroy anything, so even the light fixtures had to be preserved. Everything had to be preserved, and so it was a job that we had to hire a historic architect to do the job and he was very helpful, but it was very expensive for us to do that. The most expensive part of it was the building was not seismically approved. It was not secure, so what we had to do was to drill holes in the wall to put iron down the wall across the, the ceiling, the roof to tighten up the building both ways. That was a very expensive process, but we had to do that and we had to preserve all the things that were in the building. We couldn't get rid of anything.

A lot of people said, at that hearing, all they wanted was money for themselves, and I could hear people objecting. I says, well, they can object.

And we were still not over it because we still have a mortgage, but the mortgage has been reduced quite a bit and our present board is resolved on eliminating it possibly within the five year period. That's our goal. Course, we've had some dramatic changes we've had to make. We've had to reduce staff, we've had to cut all kinds of expenses, but luckily we've been able to eliminate our bank loans. We're free of bank loans. We have a couple of estates that came through that we didn't know about but helped us. We had to cut staff down because our overhead was just eating us up. We're still at a very, very low number in terms of hired employees, and it's gonna stay that way because we have no upswing. But we're holding our own and I got to tell you that the board of directors have been just amazing, and they've come through some very difficult periods and they've come up with personal funds that I don't know of any other organization that has done it.

I look at the health of the institution, whether it's staffed, whether people are coming and supporting us, and that we do have the ability to reach out and get more people to come in. We are in, I think at this particular time, in a very enviable position where the only thing we have is a mortgage debt. We don't have a bank loan. We have a mortgage, but the mortgage is something that can be reduced on an annual basis or accelerated with the help of the board, and the board is saying, ""Let's get rid of the mortgage,"" so they're gonna work on that next. I think the kind of people that we've been able to get to, to do the necessary things has been amazing. You got people like our board members, they come from all over and we ask them to do something and they come, come through. I mean, it's hard to describe, hard to describe. We've got one family that's picked up five hundred thousand as a new project for them, and we sold the name for the forum for two million and that money's coming in on an annual basis, so that's gonna help us reduce the mortgage as well. And we have other commitments from new board members. I think in terms of a nonprofit we are, not only among the Japanese American, but as a nonprofit organization we're one of the very few, I think, that has a viable mission and a viable board to support it. And my tenure up to this point, twenty-five years, has been very satisfying to me, to see what (has been) accomplished... and I think it has yet to go. I'd like to see the mortgage gone, but it will be gone. I would like to see the 100th/442nd come, come up. They've had some very difficult times, but if it weren't for our museum and what we're saying in our community, it's brought our reputation as Japanese Americans back up where it should be, and Japan recognizes it as well and they know that we've been terribly mistreated and that we should be given a lot more credit for having done what we did for this country, as well as what we've done for them postwar.

3121,"Well, when the war broke out, World War II, and all this information about the war and Pearl Harbor and the bad news about evacuation, the students at Roosevelt destroyed the Japanese garden there. At that time most of the students were Jewish students and Latinos, so they were aroused because of the war. I can't blame 'em. Postwar, when we came back, there were no Japanese gardens in Roosevelt, Roosevelt. It was all gone. But the students that came back and were now attending Roosevelt were mostly Hispanic, and I was raised around Roosevelt High School. Our first home was directly opposite the Japanese garden, then we moved about three blocks further to 2617 East Third Street, which was one block away from the school, so I was around the school all my life it seems. So as far as the nature of the surrounding areas postwar, it became drastically changed because of the real estate laws change. As you recall, there was race restrictions on properties and the race restrictions were eliminated soon after the war ended, and so you couldn't have any more race restrictions on the properties and so the area which was first restricted to only the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, WASPs, was eliminated from the ownership of properties, and therefore all the Jewish people that, who were prevented from owning property moved, looked like they moved wholesale from Boyle Heights to other areas, to the Valley, to mid Los Angeles. They all moved out, to Beverly Hills, everywhere, and so Boyle Heights became strictly Latino. There's only a few holdovers of Jewish people and the churches were still there, so Roosevelt became totally Hispanic and the teachers then became totally immersed in trying to get the Latinos to learn English.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3122,"Well, I was gonna ask you also, in 1994 Roosevelt High held a special Nisei graduation ceremony for those who couldn't receive a diploma because of the war, and you were one of the recipients and a speaker. When Roosevelt, they were one of the first to do this, how did that make you feel?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3123,"Buddy Webber, who was our class president, he was very sympathetic about the Japanese American situation, so he was in charge of the reunion. And he felt that it was regrettable that the Japanese Americans had never been properly given their diplomas, so he made it a special effort to invite the JAs to the annual reunion for the class and I got an invitation and so did some of the others, and I think we're about maybe eight to ten of us, showed up at the hotel near the airport. And Buddy Webber was there and he was, he was in tears. He was so happy to see us. And they asked me to say a few words and I did, and I said, ""You know,"" I says, ""I don't know too much about how others might think about a reunion like this, but it's good to know that the people at Roosevelt hadn't forgotten about us. And it's not too much about money, it's not too much about where you come from. We all lived in and around Roosevelt High School and we all got along. It's only because of the government and their policy that we split, but it's nice to be back home again with all you folks."" And we had a rousing welcome. We're still in touch. I'm still a member of the Jewish club, it's called the, trying to think of the name of the theater up on, not Brooklyn, but anyway, they, they have a name for the club and --",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

3127,"Yeah, there's the Wabash Theater up there, but they have a group, I don't know if it's the Wabash group, but we meet twice a month at the restaurant on Sunset, and I'm the only one that shows up, Japanese American. And I know a lot of the guys, my Jewish friends, so I go there every time they have a meeting and I say, ""Where's my old Jewish girlfriend, Charlotte?"" I says, ""I haven't seen her in a long time,"" but we're at that age where a lot of our friends already have passed away, but we get along. We still get along.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3128,"Now, since 1964 you've also been really active with the Manzanar High School reunion committee and, and one of the things that the reunion committee did was to make that Manzanar model at the Manzanar Historic Site. Can you share with us how that story came about?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
3129,"Yeah, when the Manzanar site was taken over by the government a lot of us in our class felt that it was lacking because no one knew what the camp looked like. They had a big photo on the wall, but that's not like having a diorama like we have at the museum that lays out the whole camp and the blocks. So Sam Ono, who is a classmate of mine, he's a structural engineer and he is so brilliant. He said, we're talking one day, I says, ""You know, Sam, the people up at Manzanar want to have a camp layout. They want a miniature camp layout."" He says, ""Well, we don't have the figures."" I said, ""What are you talkin' about?"" ""Well, we got a map and the site, site of the barracks and where they were located..."" Says, ""I could put something together."" So it turns out that I had one of the studies made of the camp that the government had made and inside it had the measurements of everything, so I took it over to Sam. Sam says, ""Hey, we could do it."" So we call members of our committee, Archie Miyatake and Saigo, what's his name from West L.A., anyway, some of our old classmates, Kaz Inagai, to a workshop. What he did, Sam, he got all the measurements and he cut up a big map into different parts, and he knew what the measurements were of the barracks and so he had cutouts made of the barracks and he laid it out for us. He had about six pieces laid out and he had miniatures, sizes of the barracks and the larger places that we needed, the hospital and all the, he had everything laid out. He's an engineer and he does everything precisely, everything perfect, and a structural engineer is one of the top engineers in the field. I mean, they design the high rises and, and so he's one of the best, but he's retired, he had nothing to do, and when I gave him all these figures he just he just grabbed them. He transformed that into a display and we used to meet down in San Pedro from, one of his relatives had a big warehouse where they laid out the forms and the little barracks and everything. And we used to go down on weekends with our high school crew, work on it, and Sam just took it upon himself to do everything. He says, ""Okay, you guys work on this."" And he had little miniature barracks and he had other stuff that looked like trees where you'd place the trees, and he had everything ready for us. He just did an amazing job. And so we prepared that for our Manzanar people and he had it built in sections that you could put one on top of the other, and we put it in a car and they took it up there and put it together. And so it's up there now as a display, and that way people could see, just like we have here at this museum, what the camp looked like, what... any camp would be fitting that model because the barracks are lined up in the same sequence. But yeah, we were blessed to have Sam around, and we spent about maybe two months and I would go out and buy hamburgers for them on Saturday. Somebody else would buy hamburgers the next weekend. Yeah, we worked on that and, and Sam and another fellow took it up and installed it at Manzanar. So that was our contribution. Yeah, so you heard about it, huh?",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

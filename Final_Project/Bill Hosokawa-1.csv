1957,And what was your name given to you at birth?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1958,"My Japanese name was Kunpei. Kunpei. First character is from kunsho. And pei is ""peace"" or ""flat,"" hiratai.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1959,Can you tell us your parents' names and where they were from in Japan?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1960,"Yes. My father's name was Setsugo Hosokawa. He came from a farming family in the outskirts of Hiroshima city. I think back then it was about a day's walk from his village to Hiroshima. Today it's about an hour's drive. And my mother, Kimiyo Omura, came from an adjoining village where her father was the soncho, or village chief.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1961,"And so when you did start public school, that you really didn't understand English. Could you tell a little bit about that experience?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1962,"[Laughs] Yes. We spoke only Japanese at home. My mother spoke very little English, and my father's English was quite limited. And so I suppose my first exposure to English was when I went to kindergarten at the old Main Street School, on Main and Sixth Avenue. And I was there only very briefly, when we moved out a little further and I went to the Washington grade school. And I knew very little English, and I just sort of had to learn by osmosis.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1963,"Well, now, at this time, it was obvious to you that you were different because you didn't speak English and you didn't understand what some of the other white American kids were saying. But aside from the language difference, when -- do you recall when you became aware of the difference as far as racially, that you were Asian -- or Japanese American rather than a white American?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1964,"Yeah. Well, the student body of Washington grade school was made up mostly of the children of immigrants. There were Spanish Jews and German Jews and Russians and even some Northern European kids. And I don't recall that there was any conflict between them and me, but we did get along, and as we became more fluent in English. We could play together, associate together. And it didn't, not take me a great, long period to become fairly aware of what was going on in the school.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1965,"So would you say about second grade or third grade, you had an awareness of, of some of these ethnic differences?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1966,"I would, I would say that very early on, the first grade, I could tell that I was different from the other kids. But that didn't seem to make a great deal of difference. And after class, why, I would go home. But by the third grade, I was mixing more with my classmates and visiting their homes, and I don't recall if they ever visited my home, but I became very good friends with a Jewish kid named Harry Glickman. And his folks ran a grocery store on the corner of the block where I lived. And he taught me a great deal about what America was all, all about. For example, I had no idea what peanut butter was, and it was a repulsive-looking thing. But he gave me a piece of bread with peanut butter on it, and I tasted it, and by golly, it was pretty good. So it was that sort of association that helped in the integration of Bill Hosokawa into the American way of life.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1967,"Well, now, during your grade school years, was this when your father was in the real estate business?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1968,"No. During that period, my father was a -- ran an employment agency. He had a little office down on Main Street, between (Fourth and Fifth), and it consisted of a little room, a telephone, and his desk, and an area where Issei men, mostly bachelors, would come and wait for jobs to show up. And my father knew enough English to answer the phone, and some well-to-do Caucasian woman would say, ""I need a boy to wash windows,"" or, ""I need a boy to, to take the rug out and beat it."" And he would find someone who was willing to do that kind of work, and send them out. And he took a small commission on their pay, and that's how he made a living.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1969,"And what, what kind of opinions or thoughts did he convey to you, if any, about interacting with white Americans? Did he talk much about problems of prejudice or discrimination or just instructions on how to behave or interact?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1970,"I can't remember that we had any conversation like that. He was busy, I was busy with my things, and I did not feel discriminated against. And he wanted me to be a good student and he encouraged me to study, learn English, but I don't ever recall him talking to me about any discrimination that I might feel. Now, I know that he was aware of those things. I could hear him talking with his Issei friends about the Ku Klux Klan and some of the hostility that Japanese immigrants were facing in California. But there was not too much of that in Washington at that time.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1971,"Did he or your mother ever talk to you much about obligation or value for, to do such community service or convey to you some responsibility of yours? That they might have influenced you to take on these kinds of activities in, as you were growing up?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1972,"Gee, I don't recall anything like that. I, I do sort of remember that -- my father's activity in community affairs was a sore point with my mother. He spent too much time doing these things, from her point of view.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1973,"And I understand also that he was as well, active with the church, the Buddhist church, and, and he sent you to Japanese language school. Did he or your mother have any clear wishes that you become a practicing Buddhist or that you become fluent in Japanese language, that type of desire?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1974,"Well, let's take that one, one at a time. My father was active in the Buddhist temple. My mother was not, although she was Buddhist. And they did not encourage me to go to the Buddhist temple, but they did encourage me to go to the Christian church. And some of their friends were members of the Saint Peter's Episcopal Church. And I would go to Sunday school there. And later on, I became friendly with some people at the Japanese Methodist Church, and I would go there. But I was never active -- I was never an active Christian, nor was I an active Buddhist. There was no effort on my parents' part to make me active in the religious movements.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1975,Do you have an idea as to why they encouraged your participation in the Christian church?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1976,"I have a vague recollection that they felt that to be more American, it was desirable to be Christian. And so they encouraged me to go to the Christian churches. Now, I would go to the Buddhist church on occasion when there were oratorical contests. I didn't take part, but I would go and listen to what was being said, and some of my friends were Buddhists. But I was not active in the temple.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1977,"...in grade school, and what happened when you went to Garfield? Was there quite a bit, quite a difference in the racial composition of Garfield school then -- quite a few more people of Japanese ancestry?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1978,"No, there were not very many Japanese Americans at Garfield. They were mostly at Franklin and Broadway. And I don't think there were more than about eight or ten Japanese Americans at Garfield at that time. There was a number of blacks, a number of Jewish Americans who came from the general district where we lived, and then there were the well-to-do kids from the Montlake area and the Madrona area. So it was a, quite a mixture of ethnic groups.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1979,"Well, then we're skipping ahead, but only because of our limited time, skipping ahead here to your college years. And I believe -- was it 1933 that you began at the University of Washington?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1980,"Yes, '33.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1981,"Well, working so closely with him and becoming very familiar with these views of Mr. Sakamoto's, did you -- perhaps that helped you clarify some of your own views. I'm wondering, did you ever think that he was going a little overboard, or did you think perhaps that sometimes questioning was in order, although that was not his policy?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1982,"Yeah. Well, at that age, I wasn't doing a lot of questioning. But yeah, there were times when I, I thought, ""Gee, I wonder why we're doing this?"" But I didn't have either the experience or the, or the confidence to say, ""Hey, Jim, don't you think that you're going overboard on this?""",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

1984,Right. As a young person.,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1985,"And that he did not believe you would ever be hired by a major newspaper. And, what was your reaction when you heard that?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1986,"Well, there were three Asian Americans in my journalism class, which was about thirty, thirty-five people. And one of them was Chinese American, a fellow named Edwin Luke, who was a brother of Keye Luke, the movie actor. And the other fellow was Shin Kobayashi. I, I was much closer to Eddie Luke than to Shin. But I know Shin was called in the, the same way I was. I don't know about Eddie Luke. But the professor wanted to know why I wanted to take journalism. And I said, ""Looks like it's an interesting way to make a living, and I like it."" And that's when he said, ""Well, you know, we don't like prejudice and discrimination, but you know it exists. And I can tell you that no American publisher is gonna ever hire you."" And I had known that, but it was something of a disappointment to have my professor say that to me. But I, I said, ""To hell with that. Why, I'm going to go ahead with this and do what I can.""",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1987,"What, what was it in you that made you make that decision?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1988,"Probably inertia. [Laughs] I didn't know what I, what else I wanted to be. I wasn't smart enough to be an engineer. I didn't particularly like business. A lot of the Japanese Americans were going into business. Some of them were going into pharmacy. And I had no aptitude for anything like that. And so I must have said to myself, ""Well, what the hell? Might as well go and see what happens.""",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

1990,"So now as you were completing your university work and graduating, I imagine as any other graduate -- senior would do, you would start looking for jobs.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1991,What did you face then? What did you find as you were applying for work?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1992,"Well, this was 1937. And there were not very many jobs for anybody. And out of our graduating class of thirty or thirty-five at the University of Washington, maybe one-third found media jobs. One fellow went to work for a post office. Another became a seaman and went to sea. One fellow went into radio work, a very good friend of mine. And some of the girls who were in the class never did go into journalism. So in that respect, jobs were very hard to find. And, I guess I recognized early on that there wasn't much point in my going around with my diploma in hand and look for a job.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1993,"Well, the JACL in the '30s was a very small, weak, and relatively inactive organization. They had a lot of big ideas, big ideals, but very little of the wherewithal to carry out those things. And you couldn't be around Jimmie very long without becoming involved in JACL, and so I did go to JACL meetings. And, oh it was a big turnout when there were fifteen people there. And I remember JACL would invite political candidates, city councilman candidates and others, to come and talk to the meeting. And there would be fifteen of us sitting there. And we had to make a lame excuse, ""We're sorry we couldn't get more people out, but every one of these people belongs to five or ten other organizations, and they'll carry the -- your message back."" Well, that was a lot of baloney, but that's about all the JACL could do. And most of the time was spent in saying, ""How can we get people to attend our meetings? How can we get membership?"" Without really having a program that would attract people. And we had -- the JACL at the time had a very vague objective of being ""Better Americans in a Greater America."" What did that mean? We didn't know. So I was one of the spear-bearers. And there were people like Jimmie Sakamoto and Clarence Arai and Shiro Hashiguchi and Takeo Nogaki, who were a little older than I, and they were the leaders.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

1996,"Yes, to the extent that it was trying to make the Nisei aware of their responsibilities and opportunities as American citizens. They were not very effective, but it was a lot better than having nothing at all like that.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1997,"...here in Seattle and were assisting the consul. And then I think shortly after that, was it, that you learned of the possibility of the job in Singapore?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1998,Yes.,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1999,"Now, in some other reading I've done, I got the impression from at least one essayist that in the 1930s, some Nisei were considering work in Asia, perhaps in Singapore or Shanghai, also in some cases Manchuria, as another place where they might face less racial discrimination. Did that -- had that occurred to you at all?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2000,"Well, no. I had never thought of going to seek my fortune in Asia, although it's true. A good many very enterprising and able Nisei went off to Japan. And some of them went to Manchuria to work for the South Manchurian Railroad. There were jobs -- Domei, for example, had five or six Nisei working for them, Domei News Agency.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2001,"And so when you got to Singapore, did you and your wife become part of a small group of Americans in that area? Did you have anyone to socialize with?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2002,"Well, we had an American consul general in Singapore. And of course, I registered there as an American citizen. I don't recall that I had any close friends among the Americans there. I made close friends with a Eurasian fellow who was part English and part Malay, I think. Very nice guy. And we had some friends among the Japanese colony. And I had some Chinese friends. But I don't recall that we made any great effort to integrate ourselves into the American colony.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

But I had no job in the States, and I had been in the Far East for a year and a half. But, I really could not consider myself an American expert on the Far East, American newspaperman -- expert on the Far East. And we talked it over for a good, long while, and we finally decided that she would go home and have the baby in the States, and I would go on to Shanghai and work a while there, maybe a year, to gain a little bit more background before going back. There was no promise of a job in the States, and I felt that I needed to qualify myself a little better. So she went on home. And I went, I went to Japan with her and put her on the ship, and then I went -- came back Shanghai by way of Manchuria -- Korea, Manchuria, North China.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2007,"Can you tell us a bit of what you observed during this trip to Shanghai, especially your observations of the Japanese activities in those areas?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2008,"Yes. I was aware, of course, Japanese had invaded and made Manchuria a colony, but I was not prepared to see the number of Japanese carpetbaggers who had gone into Manchuria. In many of the cities, they were the shopkeepers, the barbers, the -- they had moved right in. And the military was everywhere in Manchuria, the Japanese military. And so even though the Japanese said Manchuria was an independent nation, it was obvious that this was a Japanese colony. And I -- one, one time I saw Japanese troops, military people on, on maneuvers. And boy, those, those guys were rough. The noncommissioned officer was slapping a pilo -- private because he was a little slow in getting something done. And I rode on a train across Manchuria, and there were soldiers on board, armed guards. And places like Dairen, I would say was half Japanese. So was Hsinking, where the Japanese, where -- supposedly the seat of the Manchurian government, but the Japanese were running the place. And, I ran into some Nisei who were working for the South Manchurian Railway, and they were being utilized because they could handle English. But they had no authority.

2013,"What -- from your perspective there in Shanghai, how did it look to you?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2014,"Just the way you said it. Shanghai is a -- was a city of about three million there, divided into three sectors. One was the International Settlement, one was the French Concession, and one was the Hongkew side, which was -- used to be international, but the Japanese took it over. There must have been 40,000, 45,000 Japanese living in Hongkew. And they were ordinary people, shopkeepers and the like. And Hongkew was separated from the International Settlement by Soochow Creek, with Garden Bridge over it. And the Japanese had troops or guards at the bridge. And they checked everyone going over. And almost every day there would be some incident of a Japanese sentry, the Japanese guard, stopping an Englishman's car or an American's car and being very nasty. And there were a lot of Chinese coolies that went back and forth, and they were required to carry cholera inoculation certificates. And if they didn't have one, they were slapped down, grabbed, shot in the arm, and then kicked and, and told to get on their way. Tremendous arrogance.

Well, I went back to Seattle, and after a year, and a little over a year in Shanghai and a year and a half in Singapore, these were metropolises, and here was this dinky little town of Seattle. A lot of friends, but I really wasn't part of Seattle. Never had a chance to get back into Seattle before the war came.

You said that in leaving Shanghai, you were very sure that war between Japan and the U.S. was inevitable, and at that time, you were also, as a journalist, very aware of what was happening in Europe. When you got back to Seattle, what seemed to be the general awareness level of the world situation?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

I was doing whatever I could to publicize the fact that, we were Americans. You had nothing to fear from us. ""We are your neighbors. We have been born here, we live here, we work here, and we are as outraged as you are about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.""",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2044,"Well, there were some families who had no funds. Banks -- bank accounts were frozen. The head of the family might have been picked up. No, no money in the house. No food. So the Defense Council went around and gathered food and then distributed it to these families. And then the federal government required Japanese aliens to file certain documents. And many of these people had -- could not understand. It was very difficult even for English-speaking people to understand what those forms were. And we helped them fill those out. And later on when people began to move, we established a register of destinations so people in the community could keep in touch with each other after we were separated. Some people needed attorneys, and we helped them find attorneys. It was a great deal of confusion and fear, especially among the wives of the men who had been picked up. And many of them understood very little English, and so we tried to help in every way we could.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2050,"If, the first weeks after Pearl Harbor, there was very little long-range planning. It was a matter of putting out the brush fires, reassuring people that they weren't going to be shot, trying to help people who needed money, helping people fill out all these forms. The federal government really had no policy. And since they were just working from day to day, our primary effort was just to put out the brush fires. And there was no serious talk of imprisonment, evacuation. We knew that several hundred Issei in the community had been picked up, but we expected that they would be released before long. But things kept getting worse and worse. And so there was no overall defense plan. It was just a matter of trying to cope with each situation as it came up. And there was vague talk that there would be concentration camps. But we figured that would be for the Issei. And the Niseis, would say, ""Oh, they can't do that to us. We're protec-, protected by the Constitution."" So it was a real shock when Executive Order 9066 came out on February the 19th.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And I think there was just consternation when we realized that even the citizens were going to be confined. There was very little talk about resistance. The Nisei were inclined to be unaggressive, and the thought of 75,000 citizen Nisei resisting the force of the United States government, was ridiculous. We were also aware of the, of the rising tide of feeling against us. Very little defense on our behalf, and almost all hostile. Even Dr. Seuss, the, The Cat in the Hat guy, he was a newspaper cartoonist at that time, and he drew some vicious cartoons. And Walter Lippmann, who was a sort of Olympian character, the man who knew everything, and every person of authority in Washington read Walter Lippmann every morning to see what the oracle was saying.

2419,"Okay, so Bob, we're gonna start the third interview, and today is June 30, 2011. In the room we have Dana Hoshide on camera, Nina Wallace, who's observing, I'm the interviewer, Tom Ikeda. And where we finished the second interview was right at the time when you had joined InterIm, and you talked about going forward and getting a large grant, and right about that time you became executive director. And that's where we ended, so I thought we'd pick up the story there, and with the question, so now that you're executive director of this fairly new organization with some money, what do you do?",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2420,"Okay. Well, this is the most interesting time that, during the Civil Rights Movement and during the beginning of the Asian American experience and that movement. InterIm was -- InterIm, acronym for International District Improvement Association -- was started by the business community and property owners, as a quasi chamber of commerce. And it was funded, they got a little grant from the Model City Program because the International District was in the Model City boundaries. It's like it was a bird and it covered most of the Central Area, but the feet part, the leg part of the bird was down into the International District. So we applied for and got just a small grant. And when they started opening up meetings beyond the membership of the property owners and business owners it was open to the community, to the public, so the activists, those of us who were in the Civil Rights Movement, Latino/Chicano Grape Boycott, the Black Movement, the Native American Fishing Rights Movement -- [coughs] excuse me. All the Asian activists gathered in the ID. We met at St. Peter Claver Center for a couple of meetings and decided that the International District, Chinatown, Japantown, Manilatown, was under attack. I-5 was built, I-90 was being planned. This is, this is the mid '60s, early '70s. I-90 was planned. The Kingdome was a brainchild of the business community, and they were thinking about a multipurpose stadium somewhere in Seattle. The business community wanted it downtown, so the land that was affordable, available seemed to be on the railroad storage tracks, south of the government center of downtown, which is where the King Street, Union Street, King Street Station was. So all this is happening and I'm hired by InterIm because of the activists infiltrating InterIm board. There was enough people on the board when my name came up for executive director opening, I got voted in. And there was a lot of, little bit of turmoil inside the InterIm board who really didn't want me, and I think Tomio was one of those.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2421,"Right. Well, because we were demonstrating, we came from the Civil Rights Movement, we must be a bunch of Communists, and there was really a lot of tension. And so we're in this, we're in these meetings at InterIm and part of the board, I'd say one third, maybe even more of the board members left. They didn't want to deal with us. Tomio, Shigeko Uno, Don Chin, who was president of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, Wesley Tao, a couple other folks stayed on. They stayed with the InterIm board 'cause they were very interested in the energy and the smarts of these young people that were there to protect the International District from being displaced, from being destroyed by all this public development. We were surrounded by all this concrete. And so one of the first things that happened was there were lawsuits filed by young law students, Peter Bacho and Norris Bacho and some of those, to stop the stadium. Of course, that didn't work. I mean, the suit was thrown out. But the businesspeople and professionals found at that we weren't just gonna hit the streets. We also had legal expertise that were helping us so that it brought us to this little bit, little bit of sophistication, little level of sophistication. In the meantime, when the state built I-5 through the district it was elevated over Jackson Street to Dearborn, I think it was. It's elevated, so you have all this airspace between King Street and Jackson Street and this, this large airspace, and InterIm decided to go to the governor and try to work out a deal where the community that was impacted by the construction of the stadium, as a small mitigation, the community should get rights to the airspace under the freeway, right? Some of the activists were saying, ""What will we do with it?"" They said, ""We'll build a parking lot for the businesses,"" and the activists are saying, ""Baloney. You guys just want, InterIm just wants to acquire the airspace to build a parking lot for the stadium people. They don't care about the business community or the residents of the ID."" So there was give and take about that, and the thing was, let's get, let's try to get that parking lot, work out this other details later, the pros and cons of who would be using the parking lot.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2422,"But what's interesting is there's lots of, I guess, tensions, suspicions about each other in terms of motives, ""What are you doing and why are you doing this,"" at this time.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2423,"And then this is about the time I become executive director, so I became sort of the negotiator, right? I've never led a demonstration. I was always in the background, and when people were arrested and busted, except for a couple of times, I'd be left at the bargaining table negotiating what, what the needs were, why we were marching, why we were taking over offices and throwing tantrums and stuff like that. So I was hired by InterIm and I became this negotiator, and we figured out that we could build two hundred and thirty-three stalls under this freeway, so even activists, radicals, have a little business sense, right? They've all gone to school. They do the math and they're thinking, well, that's not a bad deal, if the parking lot, the priority is for the residents and the businesses in the community rather than stadium goers when the stadium would be built, 'cause it was being planned then. So everybody agreed that would be a good idea, so that was the first time that we sort of came together with a major idea of InterIm acquiring a parking lot. Now, I don't know how many nonprofits are in the parking lot business, but it's a good business. Most of the funds that nonprofits get are probably, if they're public funds then there're restrictions on what you can do with it. With the revenue from the parking concession, wow, we could lobby, we could fly to Washington, D.C., and hit all the offices and do that kind of work. So it was unrestricted.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2424,"Unrestricted funding, right.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2425,"Unrestricted funds. The first, the first year or so we couldn't give a parking stall away. We were charging -- and the state paved it and they striped it, two hundred and, two hundred and twenty-two, two hundred thirty stalls -- six dollars a month that we were charging for a parking stall per month. And for the residents it was, it was probably half of that. And we couldn't give it away. I hired a guy named Ed Hidano. He just got out of graduate school from Washington State University, and we loaded him up with these fliers. Well, we couldn't, we didn't get much movement there that we got this parking lot. Then Mayor Uhlman came up with this idea of developing a magic carpet service downtown, free bus service so that people working in the downtown area could jump on a Metro bus from one end of downtown to the other end of downtown, at lunch hour or something, and it would be good for the businesses. And it was a good idea, except the boundaries of the magic carpet service were Virginia on the north and Yesler on the south. So we got our folks together, especially the elderly, and we marched on the mayor's office. ""You're discriminating against our elderly. Our elderly should be able to ride a bus."" And so the mayor's office would say, ""Where do you suggest the magic carpet line end, or start in the International District?"" We said, ""Eighth and Jackson."" That's where the parking lot was.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2427,Now whose idea was that? Was that --,Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2429,"Now, did you have any pushback from the activists, saying, hey, now all of a sudden the land will go to benefit people working downtown and not the residents, not the businesses?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2430,"Well, that's why we set up, we set up parking rates to benefit the business, the residents first and the customers of the business in the ID first, and then monthly parking for those that worked downtown who jumped on the magic carpet service. But that was an InterIm innovation.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2431,And so was it successful? Did all of a sudden people --,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2432,"We still have it, and it's packed.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2433,"But then the residents, where did they go?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2434,"There were displacements of the residents, and the hotels and apartments that were in compliance and were allowed to stay, they were all filled up, no vacancy. When they had vacancies before the new ordinance, then they were filled up to capacity after the ordinance. So it was that time we said we can't afford to lose any more residence in our community because of freeways and stadiums and all that. I mean, those are, fire ordinance was bad enough and this would be, if we were to be, if we were to lose more of a resident base because of the stadium, we would lose the district. So InterIm's number one priority was to preserve, preservation of the district and development of new affordable housing for the residents of the community. And that meant working with the public sector, the city of Seattle, the county, the state, and the federal government, to generate resources to renovate the older buildings that were becoming, they were coming to that point of being substandard. And HUD was just a new agency about that time, so we decided to apply for resources from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to build new housing, what they call Section 8, Section 8 housing where the residents would be provided a voucher and they would pay one third of their income. If they were eligible, if they were low income, they'd pay one third of their income to Housing. So we worked with developers in the International, in the International District, private developers who came in and wanted to build this new housing using the new HUD money, the new HUD set-asides for senior housing. So we worked with developers, and the developers loved InterIm 'cause there were a couple of buildings in the International District where this, right on the verge of closing. One of 'em was the Milwaukee Hotel and, Milwaukee Hotel on Seventh and King, it was the largest hotel in the International District -- well, Milwaukee Hotel and the Bush Hotel.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2435,"Milwaukee Hotel was, was closed by the court when it was petitioned by the fire department in the mid '70s to close the building because of fire code violations. There were sixty fire code violations in the Milwaukee Hotel, so Judge Barbara Yanick with the petition from the fire department closed the building. So InterIm and the Housing Alliance and the International District Emergency Center, we got together and we said, ""Listen, we got to save this hotel."" We, remember now, we don't want any more displacement of our residents. So we petitioned the court, we all went down to the courtroom, and Judge Yanick looks at it and she says, ""It's a fire trap. People will die if there's a fire."" We said, ""We will promise to eliminate sixty fire code violations. We commit, we have a commitment that we'll eliminate these fire codes."" And she said, ""I'll give you this weekend to eliminate the ten most pressing concerns that the fire department has. Eliminate those ten, we'll come back Monday and we'll consider whether to close or not."" So we got our people together, all the activists, some volunteers, some residents of the Milwaukee Hotel, and I called for help from my buddies from the Civil Rights Movement, Larry Gossett from CAMP and the black, young black folks came down. I called Roberto Maestas at El Centro de la Raza, 'cause that had been up and running now, and they brought their folks. Bernie Whitebear from United Indians of All Tribes, and Tyree Scott from the United Construction Workers. So they all came and we, we took out, in that weekend we took out about forty tons of trash and debris from the hotel. That much tonnage, right? And Tyree Scott and some of the other construction workers, electricians and plumbers, fixed up the plumbing as good as, as well as they could, and installed an electrical system that would meet code. But we had to close up half of the building. We couldn't, in that weekend we couldn't eliminate all the fire codes, but we could eliminate at least ten of the pressing ones. That was done. We went back to the court and the fire department did an inspection, and they petitioned the judge to allow us back into the hotel and keep it open, and they trusted us, they told Judge Yanick, the fire chief told Judge Yanick that they trusted this young group, ""That have put in all this labor, they worked twenty-four hours a day to get this hotel up to shape."" And the judge said, ""Well, but the major, one of the major impediments is a fire alarm system. You can't, there's no way to install a fire alarm system. That'll take a month or two or three months to do that, and do you have the money?"" And we said no. So we said, ""We're willing to have a twenty-four hour seven day a week fire watch system. We'll have two people every four hours walk through that hotel, twenty-four hours a day."" And we committed to do that, and for two years we had this fire watch system. And in the meantime we're installing bit by bit the fire alarm system, so we had people volunteering four hour shifts all through the day, all through the night, all through the weekend, to the week and the weekend. It became sort of a party kind of atmosphere, party up 'til midnight and then, and then shut down and have the people, the fire watch people take over the building. And we would walk the hallways, check all the empty rooms. It was really a very tight controlled environment that we set up.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2438,"Well, the thing was we were, many of us knew about the International Hotel issue in San Francisco. It was the last remaining hotel on Kearny Street and it was the last building in old Manilatown. The financial district, I mean, they, the city of San Francisco just came into Manilatown and just, using the power of eminent domain, wiped out about thirty blocks that included Manilatown. And that was the last building, the International Hotel was the last building standing, and it was occupied mostly by Filipinos, Filipino elderly. And there, the business, there was a barbershop, there was Bayani Han Restaurant, and I used to go to these places. And those of us at InterIm would go down to San Francisco and check out what was happening, and it gave us inspiration that we didn't want the International District, we didn't want what happened in Manilatown to happen in the International District, which would be the wipeout of a whole community, and for us it was a whole ethnic community. Most of the people in the International District, the businesses and property owners really didn't understand why we were fighting so hard to preserve this neighborhood, this community. We were fighting to preserve the housing for the people who built it, and that was our parents, our grandparents and great-grandparents. We didn't want them displaced out of the neighborhood that they built. So we looked at other cities similar to ours for inspiration to really fight, fight hard to preserve this neighborhood.

And students from the University of Washington, the Asian students from the University of Washington and Broadway Community College at that time, Seattle Central, and a lot of the high school students, there was word around that, hey, there's gonna be a little demonstration at the groundbreaking, so all these Asian students came down. And the front of the stage were all the big shots, right, facing the stage, and in back of the stage were the activists. And speeches were going on, and the activists had painted up little signs, ""Don't let the Dome doom Chinatown,"" ""Hum bows not hot dogs."" These signs were up, and we were chanting, we, ""No stadium,"" ""We will not be moved,"" all that kind of stuff. And we started throwing little mud balls.

And that was cool, then there was yelling and they're screaming and people were being hauled away.

Why don't we turn our attention, bring our, bring our elderly and we'll have, we'll march on HUD?"" The Department of Housing and Urban Development had their offices on Second and Union, so we took the same people that were going to the stadium demonstrations, we took them down Jackson Street up Second Avenue to the HUD office and to demand that some of the new programs that HUD was, had initiated, that we in the International District would become one of the priorities for the senior housing that the federal government was offering. And so we actually occupied the HUD offices. There were two hundred, led by elderly residents. We walked very slowly up Second Avenue, and once we got there Ben Woo, myself, Norma Aziz, Peter Bacho, Frank Irigon, they only called in ten of us, and we met with the HUD officials, all white, all male, and didn't get very far. And so the word went down that we're not doin' too well, so the two hundred other people that were on the street came up, took over the whole HUD office, just, and I have a slide of that that I'll show you. And we made our point, got it in the press, got a nice little coverage about that. And one of the problems about that time was that Nixon put a freeze on all funding to new housing starts and to put a stop to a lot of programs. There was a freeze, was a government freeze on social service programs and housing programs, and so we had to wait that out. But we would go down to HUD every week and meet with staff, and they got used to us and it became a pretty good situation where, once the freeze would be lifted, the HUD promised us that if the mayor's office and the city would concur then the International District would be high on the priority of new funding. And so the freeze was lifted and we were able to get funds to build the International Terrace by the Seattle Housing Authority, Imperial House where Fuji Sushi is, that building, International House on Maynard and Weller. We worked with the developers to make sure that when they built that housing that our people were first in line. And it just so happened that some of the first people that we signed up for this new housing that would be opened up in the mid '70s were the residents of the Milwaukee Hotel. It was during this time that InterIm, we were trying to negotiate a sale with the owners of the Milwaukee Hotel, Jordan Wong and Don Louie, and their price was a little bit more than what we could afford, so we knew that at some point after occupying the Milwaukee Hotel for almost three, almost four years, that at some point we'd have to give it up because we didn't want to invest more money into a building that we would not eventually own. So we waited 'til these new apartments were being built using HUD money, and then when they were completed and the doors were opened we had our people from the Milwaukee signed up to move into the new apartments. So no one from the, from the Milwaukee Hotel was ever displaced, so that was sort of calculated to do that.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2456,"What the county did was, John Spellman was there, and the county hired a consultant, a woman by name of Diana Bower. And Diana was an architect, and in fact, she was the head planner that designed the Waterfront Park. Her and her husband helped design that. Anyway, she was a, sort of a Caucasian woman, do-gooder liberal, and she, her assignment was to work with the International District and Pioneer Square to find out how the county and the city could mitigate the problems that would be caused by traffic of the, of the Kingdome. And she started working with InterIm and started working with Pioneer people, Pioneer Square people, but she told me privately that the needs in the International District are a little bit more prominent, so she spent about seventy-five percent of her time with us and twenty-five percent in Pioneer Square 'cause she knew that in the International District we wanted to preserve the housing stock for the people who live there, the low income seniors, low income families, working families, where Pioneer Square, they were trying to rejuvenate that neighborhood to bring in more middle income, higher income people, right, and to preserve the shops there, the artists' lofts and the art galleries and the wine shops and T-shirt shops and all that kind of stuff. And in International District, she just saw a need for more attention because we wanted to build housing, we wanted to build a health clinic. So she wrote up twenty-one resolutions, working with the community, and the resolutions were written to help mitigate the traffic and the problems of the Kingdome. Seventeen of the twenty-one resolutions were passed by the city council, and that was to develop housing. The city would prioritize the International District as a recipient for funds for the federal government, through HUD, that a health center, funds for a health center be allocated, business revitalization funds, seventeen resolutions all supporting our International District redevelopment. And she was assigned to make sure that these resolutions were put in place, and so Diana worked very closely with us.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And I'd have to dig that out 'cause I forget each one of 'em, but Diana Bower took those resolutions as a marching order and so she worked very closely with InterIm. And this little old white lady, she became one of us, she was a sista, you know? Doug Chin, ""She's a sista,"" and Diana loved that, and we got a lot of, we got a lot of the demands or the recommendations funded. And so that was the lever; we used the stadium as a lever to get some of the stuff accomplished, some of these resolutions accomplished. So I'd say that the stadium, you couldn't, we couldn't stop it, but once it was there it impacted, like on a Seahawks Sunday where most of the, lot of the families outside of the International District want to bring their kids and the families want to come in for a dim sum afternoon on a Sunday. When there was a Seahawk game all the parking spaces were taken up by stadium goers 'cause they would come earlier, so that was one of the impacts that we said, hey, the businesses aren't gonna benefit from people going to the stadium.

There were a few restaurants that had deals, ticket deals, parking -- Four Seas, park here, have lunch, go to the stadium, come back, have drinks -- so they worked out some pretty good deals with their clients, but very few of the other restaurants were able to do that, or wanted to do that.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2459,"Most of the resolutions, when the radicals, when we first marched on city hall there was an organization put together by Al Sugiyama, Frankie Irigon, the Bacho brothers, a bunch of, bunch of activists, had an eight point program which included housing, health care and all that, and they marched, we all marched on, when we marched on John Spellman's office the eight demands were placed on his desk, and those eight demands were included in the seventeen resolutions passed by the city council. And I'd have to dig that out 'cause I forget each one of 'em, but Diana Bower took those resolutions as a marching order and so she worked very closely with InterIm. And this little old white lady, she became one of us, she was a sista, you know? Doug Chin, ""She's a sista,"" and Diana loved that, and we got a lot of, we got a lot of the demands or the recommendations funded. And so that was the lever; we used the stadium as a lever to get some of the stuff accomplished, some of these resolutions accomplished. So I'd say that the stadium, you couldn't, we couldn't stop it, but once it was there it impacted, like on a Seahawks Sunday where most of the, lot of the families outside of the International District want to bring their kids and the families want to come in for a dim sum afternoon on a Sunday. When there was a Seahawk game all the parking spaces were taken up by stadium goers 'cause they would come earlier, so that was one of the impacts that we said, hey, the businesses aren't gonna benefit from people going to the stadium.

2463,"[Laughs] Traditionally, or historically, it was called Chinatown. At some point after the war it started to be called the International District by some people. Now there's this hybrid, the Chinatown/International District. I mean, tell me about that, the issue of what should the area be called?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2464,"""Chinatown, get a life."" Back in the '50s there was a, there was a Mayor Clinton and a Mayor Brahman who ran the city, and there was a Chinatown. I mean, the core, Weller Street, King Street, Jackson Street, that was Chinatown. Nihonmachi was north of Jackson Street up to the hill, all the way up the, to Twenty-third or whatever that was, Yesler, Jackson. Manilatown was right within the Chinatown core, along Maynard Avenue, along Sixth Avenue. Filipino businesses were along there, and all the hotels in the whole Chinatown area were filled with Filipinos. And so we had these three major Asian ethnic groups. There was a black, a very prominent black population down here, and as you might have remembered, this was the jazz capital of the West Coast. Being at the end of the railroad lines, Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, all the porters, cooks, everybody, all the black folks that worked on the railroad line, when they came to Seattle they'd come to Chinatown International, this International Settlement. And during the war years the soldiers, the black soldiers and the soldiers of color would gravitate to the International District. So the mayor at that time in the '50s said, ""This is more than just a Chinatown, it's larger than just a Chinatown,"" and didn't want to exclude people, so they said, ""We'll name it the International Settlement,"" which includes Chinatown, Japantown, Manilatown, whatever. And a couple of years later there was, there was a flier that went around, rickshaw races. I think it was, had to be the late '50s or so. There was a bright idea from, I think, the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce to have a rickshaw race, and when it was publicized in the local newspaper it says, ""Rickshaw race in International District."" That's the first time anybody saw that term.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2465,"You know, the Local 37, the cannery worker union, was established way back in the '30s, and before the war -- excuse me [coughs] -- the workers that would file up to Alaska and work the seafood industry were Japanese, young Japanese Americans, some Japanese nationals, students, and Filipinos would go up to the canneries and work the seafood industry for the summer and make some bucks. So for the young people, they earned enough money for a college education. And when the war happened and the Filipinos were left behind, the Filipinos sort of took over that industry, at least from the war years on, and so the unions worked out deals with the seafood companies that workers that would work in the, in the cannery section would be union workers. And the company signed off on that. There was a labor agreement with the companies. And it was good for the companies, right? 'Cause they didn't have to go out and hustle workers to come up; the union would dispatch all these workers that would come into Seattle, from all over the country, mainly from California. They'd come up around May, September, springtime, in May, June, and the president of the union and the dispatcher of the union were very, very powerful figures. If you wanted to go up to Alaska and the many canneries that were really, really prominent at that time, you wanted to get ahead of the line, you paid the dispatcher a couple of bucks, or maybe more than a couple of bucks, so that became sort of the system. There there was a seniority system, but you could bypass the seniority system by paying under the table, and so it was, it began to be very corrupt and the dispatcher held a lot of power over the workers of, up in Alaska. Some of the very shrewd gambling owners, in the International District/Chinatown core there was a lot of gambling operations, the Filipino Improvement Club owned by Rudy Santos, the Bataan Club was owned by a guy named Dan Sarisol. These were big casinos, underground, underground casinos. Well, they wanted to, because all these Filipinos were going up to Alaska, they wanted to establish gambling in the canneries where they would send, where the gambling establishments would send up their people to be the dealers, 'cause all these, here you have all these guys with nothing to do and they come, they'd make a lot of money up there. And there was a system of keeping track, whatever kind of system it was, and a lot of these workers, cannery workers would lose their whole, their whole salary to the gamblers. When they, before they left Alaska and got their checks, there it was, so that became very lucrative. So the gambling industry in the cannery, canneries of Alaska, was very prominent, and so in order for that to happen the gamblers would pay off the dispatcher to get their people up. They were in place when the rest of the workers came up. So, and I was one of those cannery worker kids out of high school, two years, 1951 and 1952 I went to Alaska, but my dad was a very prominent boxer, so he got me in without having to pay off the dispatcher.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

The United States government, of course, had to be very careful how they treated Marcos and those people because we needed the military bases that were in the Philippines.

We were demonstrating once a week, I think it was every Tuesday at the Philippine consulate for the end of the martial law.

So that struck a chord with the Marcos regime that this anti martial law alliance was getting a little bit bigger than they wanted to get big 'cause they were getting international support from unions and officials from all over the United States, so the two guys were targeted.

I spoke, I mean I went to a conference in Portland a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, and on the panel was a new group that was formed with a Latino, African American, and a Native American. And there was no Asian up on the panel and they had formed a group, and when I asked the question, why don't you have representation from the Asian community, and the answer was -- and this is the housing conference -- the answer was, ""Well, most Asians own their own homes."" It didn't register with me, but I said, at that time I said, that's not right. That's not true. And so I think, like, Portland was trying to get these communities together, but they didn't quite make it. So I've never, none of us have ever seen a coalition, and we formed the Minority Executive Directors Coalition, which from four members has turned into about a hundred and sixty individual members that represent their organizations or agencies.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

He passed away several months ago, but when he became sick, the word came up from Cuba that invited Roberto down to Cuba and they would take care of him with the medical expertise that they have. But he would've had to move his whole family there and he decided he was eventually gonna pass away, it's gonna be here. But he was also involved, El Centro, when it was formed, soon as they, after they occupied the Beacon Hill School and it became El Centro, there was an earthquake in Nicaragua and devastated Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, so El Centro, they packaged all this foods and stuff and they sent care packages down to Nicaragua. So there was an immediate relationship from the government of Nicaragua to the, to the staff at El Centro, and Roberto became very close to the Sandinista government. So when Reagan was president and the U.S. forces were stepped up to eliminate the Contras, the Sandinista government, Reagan actually wanted to invade Nicaragua. Well, Maestas would organize delegations of Americans, locally and eventually nationally, to visit Nicaragua to actually observe the kinds of treatment the people in Nicaragua were having under this regime. And the Gang of Four, all four of us, were on those delegations. And Roberto, I mean, myself, I almost give him singlehandedly one of the reasons why Nicaragua was never invaded. We had more Americans there than we had here in Seattle. They were always on these delegations.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

But in that race for county council was, Ruby Chow was there, right, and I wanted to run against her. I wanted to beat her badly. I just, her and I just could not get along. And Ron Sims also was in that race, and I didn't care about running against Ron. I just wanted to run against Ruby. So I declared to run, and about that time Ruby decided she didn't want to, I don't think she wanted to campaign against Ron and myself, so she retired and Cheryl took her place. Instead of backing out, I kept my campaign going, and I lost, lost to Ron Sims. So I was out of, so I'm out of a job, and so the PDA, so I left InterIm and InterIm started up the PDA, so PDA had the executive position open, so I applied for the PDA executive, their director position and was interviewed, and the board was split. People like Tomio thought we should have someone that was more business oriented. We didn't need any more activism. And I sort of lobbied my way in to get that one vote that I needed. And Tomio, we're okay with that. We talk about that all the time. But it was the same time that Metro property at Eighth and Dearborn was surplus, so I was hired and my job was really to see if we could acquire that property at a deep discount. So I worked out a deal. I worked out a deal with Metro. I said, ""Since you have your maintenance facility, Metro maintenance facility in our property and it's been a negative impact, you bring nothing positive to the International District, when you surplus it we in the International District, through the PDA, should have first opportunity to apply for the, to buy the property before you send it out to public bid."" Metro said fine. ""We understand that. We haven't been a good neighbor. One of the problems, though, is that the federal government, through the Department of Transportation, lent us the money, two thirds of the money to purchase that property in 1974, so you'd have to talk to them to see what they're willing to do."" So I met with a guy named Terry Ebersol. He was regional administrator for UMTA, Urban Mass Transit Authority, and they're the ones that had the reversionary rights of the property. So I went to Terry. We had lunch at the Four Seas. ""Terry, the DOT really need the 1.7 million dollars that the property was appraised at."" It was sixty-four thousand six hundred square feet of property divided by Eighth Avenue, two half blocks. He says, ""Bob, you know how that, you know how the government works. We have to get, we have to either get the money or get it off our books."" So boom. Called Bill Nishimura. I said -- he was regional administrator for HUD -- I said, ""Bill, would you be willing to come to a meeting with Terry Ebersol with Department of Transportation?"" Sure. ""Sure, Bob."" And Bill was good. He always... I called Sue Taoka, who was working then with Mayor Norm Rice. She was like one of the deputies up there. I said, ""Sue, why don't come to this meeting?""",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2499,"so we met, and in the meantime I'm talking to a guy named Jim Gonzoles, he was the Washington State coordinator for Brock Adams' office. I knew Jim. I talked to Rita Jean Butterworth, who was the state coordinator of Slade Gorton's senatorial office. I knew Jean. You know how we had to go to all these receptions, and that's a part of our life. We meet people. And every time I met these aides I'd take 'em to lunch. I could never take the senator to lunch, but I could take an aide to lunch, right? They're always willing to find out what's going on. Took down, talked to them, and I said, ""I'm meeting with these government officials and I want your support,"" and I told 'em what we wanted to do. We wanted to acquire the piece of property at Eighth and Dearborn, to build an intergenerational, multicultural, multilingual facility to serve the elderly, low income elderly, families, families with children. And they loved the concept. They said, okay, we'd support that. Let's, I'll call the boss and see if we can support that. So I have these, all these people in the room, so I looked at Terry Ebersol. I said, ""Terry, remember our conversation? If you could get it off your books or I get the money? Would you be willing to transfer the interest of your department, the interest of your department over to another federal agency just to get it off your books?"" He said yes. ""Bill, would you be willing to accept it and immediately transfer it over to the city as a block grant?"" HUD, right? A regular community development block grant, and get it over to the city. ""And Sue, would Norm be willing to allocate that same parcel of land to us as a block grant?"" Right? And, of course, everybody says, ""We do it all the time."" So we get two thirds of the property. It actually happened with the help of the two senators we got that two thirds of the property transferred through, to us at no cost. Now I had to lobby the county, the Metro council for their one third of the property, which was at that point, what, seven hundred thousand or so. They wanted fair market value and a whole bunch of lobbying went on, and I met with all of them, and I got them to sell their piece of the land to me at a hundred and fifty thousand.

We'd go down to HUD and we'd fill out applications and write proposals, and we'd get funds for the housing stuff, but I didn't know, really didn't know all the programs. For the first time in my life I get some manuals of HUD programs and try to study. At that time HUD had twenty, two hundred programs under Department of Housing and Urban Development. And I'm saying, oh shit, this is impossible. In the airplane to D.C. I'm studying. I get up at four o'clock in the morning for an eleven o'clock meeting with Cisneros because I got to study 'cause I want, 'cause he's gonna grill me on what I know about HUD. So I got to the HUD office, eleven o'clock appointment, and I say, hi, my name is Bob Santos.

I was over at the White House."" I said, ""I heard."" And he said, ""I really wanted to talk to you, but we only have a few minutes, so could you sit down?"" And I'm thinking, of all the two hundred programs HUD has, there's only three I really know, so I hope he asks me questions on these three programs, FHA, public housing, and block grant. I know them. I didn't know the hundred ninety-seven other programs. So we sit down, he looks at me and says, ""Bob, would you work for me?"" And I'm thinking, ""I thought I was here for an interview. He's offering me the job."" So I started telling him the three programs that I knew about HUD. He said, he says, you don't have to worry about that. He says, ""The only thing you have to worry about is we have, your name has to go before a couple of committees, IRS, and the FBI."" I said, oh shit. There goes that job, the FBI file.

These radicals were hangin' out -- well, they didn't say they were radicals. They were with the WTO people, but they had gone to the Bush a couple of times, just sort of have a beer or so, and I was singing, so they heard me then. And so when they said that, things sort of calmed down, and I said, ""Listen, I know you guys want to wait it out 'til this building is converted over to the homeless. One thing I promise you I will do, I'll talk to the owners because there is a group out there that he might be willing to talk with in negotiating the future of this building as a housing for homeless people. But I'll only talk to them if you walk out with me."" I looked around, and everybody's eyes sort of, you could tell they're saying, there's an excuse to get out of this mess. So they did. I go down the ladder and they all followed me out, and as we went out the door there's this big cheer from all these other people, their supporters from outside. They'd gained a victory. Well actually, what happened was that when I went back to Wei Lui, he said he'll talk to the SHARE/WHEEL advocates, but he said he doesn't think they could meet his price, so it never did, it was never converted to homeless. But I got the people out, so that was, my goal was to make sure no one got hurt.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2512,"with that, Sharon and I go out, and Sharon says, ""You got to go up there."" The radicals had locked themselves, barricaded themselves into this building. It's a four story building, and they barricaded themselves and they had booby traps and all that kind of stuff. So they sent me into the building to talk to the leadership, who were on the roof looking down on the cops to see when the cops were coming in. So I go up the stairs, three flights of stairs, and the ladder from the third floor to the roof. And as I'm going up the ladder I'm thinking, ""What the hell am I doing doin' this? I'm gonna be a hostage."" And I'm thinking all this stuff in my mind, and so I go to the top, and all these young people had their bandanas across their eyes, their noses and their faces, but their eyes were all bloodshot. They were tired. And individually, collectively they wanted to stay there. Individually, I know they would, they would want some kind of excuse to get out of there, 'cause they didn't want to get beat up by the cops that were gonna come in. So they all circled around me, and Jeff, the guy that called me, were all there, and there's a photographer from Life Magazine was among that group. Anyway, he says, ""Okay, gang, this is Bob Santos.

2517,"I, you know, I think about that. I think it's sort of a selfish feeling that you have that you can do something. You can be a radical in some ways, you can be a negotiator in some ways, but every time you're in a situation you have control. I always think I have control over what can happen during a meeting and the result of a meeting, whether it's with the mayor's office or the property owner or something. I always feel inside that I'm gonna control the outcome of this meeting, and maybe one out of ten times that happens. But the one time it does happen, you might have, we might have done something ten or twenty times, that feeling that you have when you come out of a meeting or you come out of a building or you have a, you do a groundbreaking or a ribbon cutting for something that you worked to help start, that is a feeling that you can never... I mean, I imagine if, equivalent of winning a gold medal at the Olympics, I imagine, is the feeling that I have when something really nice happens.",Legal challenges#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

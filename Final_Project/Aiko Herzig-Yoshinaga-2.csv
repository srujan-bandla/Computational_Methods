327,"Well, I wanted to start off with your involvement with Asian Americans for Action and how did this all come about?",Pre-war background to the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
328,"Asian Americans for Action. That was a group of, I guess what persons call progressives, activists in New York City. It was established by, as I understand it, two ladies: Kazu Iijima and Shizu ""Minn"" -- Minn is her nickname -- Matsuda. And they were senior citizens, which was rather unusual because so many Nisei, and especially women who were already senior citizens, didn't tend to involve themselves in social issues that were, that was really running the, throughout the country during that period which is late '60s, in the '60s and the '70s.",Legal challenges#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
329,"was really impressed with the feeling that pervaded between the people and the subjects they talked about. And I found out it was really sort of a study group for people who were interested in learning more about other systems of government. That was the first time I saw Don Nakanishi and Glenn Omatsu, they were students, I think either Harvard or Yale, someplace, and I think they were looking around, too, and they were sitting in on this thing. So I, actually my first meeting with them goes back, ooh, '69 maybe. How many years is that? Thirty something years, almost thirty years I think 'cause I lost track of them between (that) time but I'm so happy to be back in the circle, in the circle again.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Military services#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
330,"any rate, this group I attended monthly meetings to learn a little bit about our democracy, our democratic system and about Marxism, Leninism, about which I knew absolutely zilch. Nothing I knew about these things. But I tried to pick some of the good points about all of these different systems and thinking, ""Oh, how wonderful to have a utopia,"" if we could develop a country that picked the best out of all these systems. This organization interested me because they were tackling issues like -- for Asian Americans -- to me it was interesting -- they would talk about the Vietnam War. And this was of course earlier in the '60s, late '60s -- oh, that's right, we were still in the war at the time, of course. Because they were not afraid to walk the streets of New York joining other groups to decry our involvement in Vietnam. Shouting slogans, carrying placards and doing the things that demonstrators generally do who want to protest government action. I'd never done anything like that and I felt as a Nihonjin, I thought, ""We don't do these things like that,"" you know, and we are, we're quiet and we discuss things behind doors. We don't go parading our emotions out in the streets, especially in New York City.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Redress movement#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
331,"Therefore, when I joined this group I was amazed that these senior citizen ladies were willing to go out in the streets and shout and let the government know, ""We don't like what you're doing and we're part of this country and you're, with our tax money, you're carrying on this unwanted war."" Well, I decided I'd take the plunge and join one of these marches. And I was just as nervous as a cat. You know, walking down the streets of New York, carrying a placard, having so many people on the sidewalks watching you and taunting you. And especially if you're Asian, you know, they are saying nasty things like, you know, ""Go back to where you came from,"" and, ""What do you gooks think you're doing?"" Things like that. It was terrifying for me.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Legal challenges#Military services
332,"wouldn't you know, the first march I ever did in Greenwich Village, they had a picture of the march, quite a large picture, and who is in the picture in the middle of the picture? Me. And I thought, ""Oh-oh. Wonder what is my family is going to say?"" Sure enough, my family was not very pleased, the rest of my sisters, siblings -- not very pleased with what I was doing. They were a good, quiet Christian family, wonderful people, but they thought I was always very hard to handle, and here I go again. Black sheep of the family, involving myself in activities that would be frowned upon by the rest of the community, most likely. And my sister very quietly let me know that she thought, ""What are you doing? Don't you know what you're doing is going to affect the rest of us? How do you think I'm going to feel when I go to church?"" That kind of quiet pressure. But it... they realized that that's just not going to stop me, because I felt that I was, what we were doing was right. But it was an experience. I learned from these people because they were just full of the world in their heart.

334,"that, I'm sure, had the most effect -- my connection -- on starting to think about our own experience back in wartime, and why did it happen, and what we were suffering from as a result. I never really thought that much about it. In the first place, of course, I was raising children and it was pretty busy. Survival was the main concern right after the war. But it was, the Triple A experience is the thing that triggered my becoming what some people call activist. The Triple A had also instituted a program, an annual program to commemorate Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. That was a great thing, I thought. You know in New York City, what we did was, started with the churches, and said, ""Can we, can we use the church for just a program?"" And I think the Japanese community, as small as it was in New York City, looked a little askance at this group, because of the kinds of issues they, they were interested in, and because, particularly because of the lack of hesitancy to protest publicly about many government actions.

336,"this movement to commemorate Hiroshima and Nagasaki continued annually after that, and I thought that was another very good thing that the Triple A had initiated, and made Japanese Americans aware. Not only Japanese Americans, but primarily Japanese Americans who were pretty indifferent about a lot of things. And since you don't have the kind of population of Japanese Americans in New York that you have in the West Coast, it is hard to get a feeling of community there. Many of the people (who) used to live in New York City, Manhattan, have moved, had moved out to the suburbs, like they have from L.A., too. But there were not enough in number of the Japanese American to give you a great feeling of roots of community. So of course, the church served -- the Buddhist church there and the Christian church -- served as a central point of meeting and of holding gatherings in New York City.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
337,"The Asian Americans for Action continued to do its work. I remember being, recall the Native American Affairs and remember meeting Ted Means, Russell Means' brother. Oh, and that was when I think Peltier was arrested and we were trying to help to get a fair trial for him. We involved ourselves in various issues. I remember Zimbabwe, Rhodesia -- that was one of the issues. One of the leaders, of course, was Mary Yuri Kochiyama, and she, of course, had so many connections. She met everybody from the whole world and I remember she brought, I think it was Robert Mugabe's brother to one of the meetings to talk about the problems before Zimbabwe was turned over to the natives -- this was, they were under colonial control. But you can see the wide range of activities in which we got involved, and had, of course, largely to do with the Iijima's family and Kochiyama family and Minn Matsuda, primarily those three. Because so many of the -- a number of the members that were, not recruited because there was no recruiting going on -- but came from the Christian church -- there was a real nice connection, that they were able to take back some of the messages to the church, about oppression in other countries, to people who worked at the headquarters at the Methodist or Presbyterian church in New York City. If they heard about some of the things happening in Triple A, they could take the message back to the headquarters, and make people in the church, in the international division or wherever, aware that -- ""How about paying some attention to these subjects?"" So it had subtle, but far reaching consequences, I think, that Asian Americans for Action's activities generated.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
338,"I have always been proud to say that I had been one of the early members. And I was very sorry to hear that they had disbanded and I don't know why. I left New York City to come to live in Washington. I think the times changed, international affairs, different kind -- of course, the Vietnam war ended to begin with, that helped, I'm sure. But each one of those persons who were members previously of Triple A, I think they became involved in other issues, like women's issues. There's an Asian women's organization. Some of the members involved themselves with that. And I think there were other movements, so the work actually hasn't died. I think it's taken on different names.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

342,"Yeah, I think, I think it was still active. Or else it was starting to wind down, '77, '78. I have a feeling they were still in existence at the time. I got involved in my work and a lot of personal things, you know.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
343,"Now, you'd mentioned that the Triple A had actually gotten you started in thinking about your own experiences in the camps, and things of that nature. So how did you take action? When you started thinking about that, what did that make you pursue?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
344,"Oh, yes, because when we started to talk about the camps and the connection of why the government -- we didn't have the facts, of course, at the time -- but we started talking about why was it that the government did this to the ethnic Japanese. And, oh, had I known then what I know now, after having gone to the archives I would have felt like a queen. But since we didn't know, we discussed that a lot and we... I think that it was ""never again."" That those two words stick in my mind. That was on a big poster: ""never again."" That, had to do with the camps. I'm trying to think of the origin of why we had a protest, and I think it had to with the camps. The Holocaust movement, the anti-Holocaust movement among the Jews, I think they used ""never again"" as one of its rallying cries. And I guess we picked that up, Triple A, and we had a ""never again"" short movement to make people aware of what happened to the Japanese Americans. And because I remember seeing posters and I may even still have one, as a matter of fact. I would have to check with Kazu Iijima or Mary Kochiyama to recall exactly what that particular subject was, but we started talking about the camps.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
345,"I went to the National Archives, and I was quite surprised at the amount of information that they had about me. But then when I think back, yes, when we went into camp, we filled out all kinds of forms. And so why shouldn't they have this, but I was surprised they kept it. Little old inconsequential me? But they kept everybody's papers: school records, dental records, medical records, letters that went in and out of camp. They kept everything and they ended up putting them in individual folders for each person. If you were a child, your papers may have ended up in your mother or father's folder. But, and sometimes there were individual folders I know for children, too. I remember seeing some drawings, report cards, things like that. However, as I started to do this work for myself, my family, looking up records, the archivists there said, ""Do you know there is some wonderful records about this camp experience in the archives, and there's not enough people looking at it, it's so interesting. Would you like some help to find it?"" Well, sure why not, I have the time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
346,"so I started to examine those records, and they grabbed me, absolutely grabbed me. So one, of course, I started with the War Relocation Authority records, 'cause that's where our records were kept. Then all these records referred to other records like military records, or State Department records, which means you have to go to different branches in the archives -- the same building, but different branches. And so, the search spread, and spread, and spread. And I would call Michi Weglyn, and said, ""Look, your book said this particular document was, is in this particular branch."" And we would discuss my being able to find it, or not to find it, or the consequences so we carried on a lot, long distance conversations for years and years while I went through this. She was so encouraging, so generous with her time. I just love that lady. Anyway, that's how my search started, that's how it evolved.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
347,"think they had a tremendous influence on Congress, the legislators to consider the legislation, passing the legislation. We spoke to congressmen and especially in the House, we spoke to Barney Frank after the bill was passed, long after at a social event one time. And we asked Mr. Frank, ""Can you tell us, now that it's all over with, what you think was the effect of the class-action lawsuit on the bill, the redress bill?"" And he said, ""There's no question about it."" Why? Because at the time they voted that bill -- this is to be understood, the timeframe is very important -- the time the Congress, House voted that bill, the Supreme Court had not yet come down with the decision on Hohri. I think the Supreme Court was waiting a little bit to see what Congress would do. [Laughs] And Mr. Reagan, President Reagan signed the bill in August 1988. Supreme Court denied hearing Hohri in October. By that time, I think they figured, Supreme Court Justices figured, ""Well Congress has voted them, the Japanese Americans an amount, $20,000 per survivor or heirs, so why do we need to hear this?"" But I think they were actually, I think they were little afraid to hear it because the opening up and going to trial -- an open trial of Hohri vs. U.S. -- would have brought up a discussion, definitely, of the validity of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, you know, all those cases. They would have had to look at it again and say, and talk about the constitutionality question, which had never been addressed by the Supreme Court. Even in the wartime cases, the Supreme Court of those, of 1944, did not address the constitutionality question of exclusion and incarceration. They addressed curfew, they addressed the law, when military regulations that said a Japanese person must report for quote ""evacuation"" we call it exclusion. They addressed this thing about curfew with Mr. Hirabayashi, however, they never tackled the constitutional question.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Redress movement#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
348,"it was one of the primary goals of Hohri vs. United States, not to get redress financial compensation alone, but to define all of the injuries, specifically the deprivation of privacy, the deprivation of the right to travel, the deprivation to assemble, freely, assemble. Not only that, but to reopen, to reconsider Korematsu. And to actually wipe it off the books. The lower courts in 1983, four, five, four or five, I guess, did wipe, did vacate Korematsu, Hirabayashi, but they never, it did not erase those cases from the books, because the Supreme Court is the only body that can erase its own decisions, okay. It's very hard to understand some of these legal things. It's only because I got involved in doing some of the research with my husband for these cases that I now understand and I can say ""coram nobis"" and I can say ""sovereign immunity,"" you know, without tripping over those words, and I understand those few concepts now. I have -- and it's because of the wonderful legal people that we worked with -- patient, knowledgeable, and just loving. Peter Irons, and Dale, and Ellen Carson and Don Tamaki, all those, Dennis Hayashi, all those people. Just lovely people and I learned so much, Jack and I learned so much from them. As lay persons, it's difficult to deal with these legal issues, but I learned the process where you start a case, it goes up to another court, it goes to Appeals, it gets transferred to another court, and goes up to the Supreme Court. And I learned that if you lose a case, you can appeal. If you win, there is no reason to appeal to a higher court. Okay. In Hohri, we lost, so we appealed (from) the lower court, so we appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided not to hear us. And as I told you, I don't know if it was because the law was already passed for redress in Congress or whether they really didn't want to hear it. In the coram nobis case, the coram nobis lawyers won and the government did not want to appeal to the Supreme Court. I knew, I know they knew they were going to lose. I'm sure, so, they didn't appeal those decisions.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Redress movement
349,"of the things, for example, that I did not mention during the session, that Mr. McCloy objected to was that the report said Japanese Americans were removed from the West Coast because no matter how long it took, we would never be able to determine whether or not they are loyal to the United States. Now, Mr. McCloy said, ""Now if that is not a racist, bigoted statement, what is?"" And Mr., General DeWitt's statement also said, ""Well, we had to, we didn't have time to separate the sheep from the goats."" That put us in a such a category, sub-human nature, even Mr. McCloy objected to that. The other thing the statement said was that, ""We want to keep these people, anybody with Japanese blood, 1/16th Japanese blood, in these camps for the duration of the war."" And as I mentioned yesterday, Mr. McCloy was horrified at that idea, because he wanted to clean out the camps right away, as soon as possible. He wanted them to be relocated outside the military zone and to start homes elsewhere because by the end of the war he did not want some conditions comparable to Native Americans' reservations, having Japanese American reservations that the government would be responsible for taking care of, and he was determined the camps be closed as soon as possible. But, he was trying to give General DeWitt some respect as a commander, however, this was just too much for him to take, and he was not pleased about the report.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And we made arrangements with the printer that we're going to have more copies made but I wanted to show you what a finished product looked like."" So, well, Mr. McCloy was totally unhappy with not just those three or four things I told you about, but many other parts of the report. And so this began a series of memos and telephone conversations between the West Coast and the War Department in Washington as to the nature of the changes, the words to be changed, the phrases to be knocked out.

Smith saying that, ""I have witnessed the destruction of galley proofs, memos, letters having to do with the first version of the final report."" Okay, so since I knew the history behind the fact that there was an original version, I had seen it; that was the only reason I recognized this particular book that was sitting on the corner of an archivist's desk that I was thumbing through. I looked at it and said, ""Ooh, this looks like the final, DeWitt's final report."" But I noticed in the margin many handwriting things: ""delete,"" ""scratch,"" ""change to,"" ""move to page so and so."" And, oh, my goodness. This is one of the first versions. And this is the one that they could not locate. There had been ten copies, messages and cablegrams went back and forth between McCloy's office and the Western Defense Command saying, ""Hey, we got nine copies back, where is the tenth copy? We've got to find it."" Well, apparently they never found it. I never saw any documents saying, ""Here is the tenth copy,"" or anything. It ended up in somebody's office in the War Department when everything was moved over to the archives. It got mixed in with all the papers that belonged to the War Department. Either the War Department downtown -- in Washington or Western Defense Command. I think it's the Western Defense Command, because they worked from the notes to make the changes. So I recognized this as that one, the tenth copy that was missing. And I told the archivist, I said, ""Do you know what you have here?"" No, he didn't realize. And I gave him a brief run-down. And I thought, he was really tickled about it because there was supposedly, it was supposed to have been lost. And here he, now he had it.

I have a feeling, there was a question in the plenary session saying yesterday, ""Was something done on purpose, do you think the government was hiding something on purpose?"" I think that was the nature of the question. And I don't think so. I don't think if -- maybe there's something that our National Security Agency is holding back, perhaps. But in terms of our history, of our Japanese American history, I have never felt that there was anything really being hid. I've seen documents that are saying, ""This document was removed from the file for security purposes."" But usually you can trace those somehow, you can trace them back.",Military services#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
354,"it's a matter of, sometimes, of simple filing. I think people look at these files, they don't put them back where they belong. I tell you, I blame a lot of it on researchers. If it's misfiled, oftentimes, it's because some researcher has pulled out a file from a box and put it down, pulled out another file from a box, put it down, and then maybe mixed them up. Not on purpose, perhaps, but without thinking. Once researchers look at a piece of paper, they think, ""Oh great, I'll Xerox this,"" and then they don't care where they put it back. I've seen this happen. And it's really upsetting because we put a citation on it. We found it here, this box, this folder and then you go to that and it's not there because somebody had not put it back in the same place.

73,"So today is Tuesday, July 7, 2009, and we're in Torrance, California, at the Holiday Inn in a hotel suite. And on camera we have Dana Hoshide, and the interviewer, I'm Tom Ikeda. And so, Aiko, I'm going to just start at the very beginning. Can you tell me when you were born?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
74,"I was born August 5, 1924, in Sacramento, California.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
75,"And were you born in a health facility or with a midwife, do you know?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
76,"I believe it was a midwife, because my birth certificate says midwife -- I think it's a midwife -- Ai Miyazaki. So I didn't see a doctor's name.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
77,"Okay, good. And when you were born, what was the name given to you at birth?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
78,Aiko Yoshinaga.,Pre-war background to the incarceration
79,Any middle names or anything like that?,Pre-war background to the incarceration
80,"No, not at that time.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
81,"Good. Before we talk about your father and mother, can you tell me your siblings kind of in birth order so we can have that?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
82,"Yes. I had a couple of half sisters who I never met, because they passed away before I was born. But I had, the chonan, the oldest brother, was Frank Nobukazu, and then two sisters, Aya, next sister Ei, E-I. She didn't have an ""Eiko,"" it was just ""Ei.""",Pre-war background to the incarceration
83,"And generally between Frank and Aya, Ei, Johnny, what was the age difference between everyone?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
84,"Oh, it was quite a bit. I think I remember figuring out the difference in age between my youngest sister and my oldest brother was, like, twenty-four years. So it was, the space between my second sister and Johnny was bigger because that's the time my father brought the oldest three siblings from Japan. They had been separated for several years, and then my brother was born after my mother and the rest of the family came to California.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
85,So let's talk about your father next. Can you tell me his name and where in Japan he was from?,Pre-war background to the incarceration
86,"His name was Sanji Yoshinaga, and he was born in Kumamoto.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
87,"And do you know anything about his family, what they did?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
88,"I think he was the second son, which meant that he would not inherit anything. And he was always scholarly. He wanted to pursue education. Apparently he was a math teacher in Japan, but... and I'm not sure when he converted or if the whole family had been Christians, but he came, actually, as I understand it from my older sister, he came to try to become a Christian minister here. So he wanted to go to a seminary, but, for I don't know what reason, economic or what, he was never able to do that. But he became active in the Christian church, especially at that time, the Baptist church. He was always reading and seeking spiritual information.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
89,"Oh, that's interesting. You mentioned, sort of, half sisters. So was your father married in Japan and had children?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
90,"He was married in Japan, and then his, that wife passed away, then he married my mother after the other wife passed away.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
91,"Your mother, what was her name and where was she from?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
92,"Oh, she had an unusual name. During those days, even women were given men's name, maybe in anticipation by the parents that a boy would be born. Her name was Shigeru Kinuwaki. And my mother was very happy to be able to say, ""I come from a line of samurai retainers."" There was a well-known daimyo in Kumamoto called Hosokawa, and apparently, my mother's grandfather was a retainer for the Hosokawa daimyo. And I know that to be a fact because when I visited Japan, oh, 1992, I think, I went to the gravesite of that Kinuwaki family, and the gravestones had the Hosokawa crest, the mon. So apparently, that was not one of the stories a lot of people like to say, ""We come from a samurai warrior clan,"" but in my mother's case, it apparently was true.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
93,"Well, and so how did your mother and father meet?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
94,"I never knew that. I asked my father one time, and he said, ""I called over the mountain and she came."" [Laughs] That's the only thing I know. And it was, my mother apparently had been married before. And it was probably hard for a woman who had been married once before to be remarried. But it was interesting that when I was divorced, my mother chastised me for bringing embarrassment to the family. And then, many years later, I found out she too had been married before. So I confronted my mother, who was a sweet, gentle soul, one of the sweetest women I ever knew. And I said, ""How come you got on my case for having been divorced?"" And as little Japanese as I understood, I was able to understand this much from her. She said, ""Well, in those days, way back in the end of the 19th century, we didn't have things called divorce. So my then-husband didn't get along with my mother. And so he just walked off into the sunset and I never saw him again. That's the same as a divorce, but we didn't have to go through this messy court stuff. So it's not the same as you divorcing."" [Laughs] ""Okay, okay, Mom, I got it."" That was so funny.",Pre-war background to the incarceration

97,"That's interesting that you didn't know, and I'm guessing the community didn't know that she had a previous husband?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
98,"I think they didn't. I don't think anybody did. 'Cause apparently, that marriage didn't last very long. There were no children. And I guess my mother's mother was pretty tough. It was a yoshi case, what is it, when a man comes and marries into the woman's family instead of vice-versa and takes the family name, that woman's family name and drops his own last name, right?",Pre-war background to the incarceration

103,"And what was... oh, that's right. Going back to your mother's family, what kind of work did her family do?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
104,"I think they had a tea farm. I don't know what my father's side was doing, but I recall my mother said something about having a tea farm. She loved working with the earth, 'cause I know she liked growing things when we were living in Los Angeles.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
105,"Okay. So this is interesting. So your father had three children, and he's recently married to your mother. And at that point, they decide to come to the United States?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
106,"My father came first, I guess trying to find out what the land was like and what the possibilities were like. And I'm not sure how long he was here before he came back, went back to Japan to bring my mother and the three, my three siblings over. So it was the turn of the century, like 1905 or something like that.",Pre-war background to the incarceration
107,"And do you know what he found in America, where he settled?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
108,"Just struggles. [Laughs] He was never a businessman. I think he tried several different businesses, but just never succeeded in it. And so he never did get to the seminary to study to become a minister, but he was always active in the Christian church. He ended up having, managing hotels in Los Angeles. And I think in Sacramento he was doing that, too. He tried a little business like tofu-ya, making tofu or something like that, and that didn't go, didn't take. But when we came to Los Angeles, he was managing a hotel. And then he ended up having a small vegetable and fruit stand on Western Avenue, I remember that. And the funny, main thing I remember about that experience was that instead of the cash register, he used to use the soroban, the abacus, to calculate purchase and change that he had to give the customer. And it just fascinated me that he preferred to use the abacus rather than the cash register. [Laughs]",Pre-war background to the incarceration
109,"Yeah, that's a good idea. So when you were born, you mentioned earlier you were born in Sacramento. So your father was doing different things, and I wanted to ask, what was your father like? I mean, he's doing these different things, you described him as sort of scholarly. What kind of personality did your father have?",Pre-war background to the incarceration
110,"Well, he looked stern, but he wasn't. He just had that ""I'm the boss"" kind of look, but he was not. And never laid a hand on us, and just his demeanor, if he was displeased, would be very sharp and stern. But (...) I think I was spoiled. I'm pretty sure I was. But he, unfortunately, because of the language barrier, I didn't communicate with him too much. He knew English, he spoke some English, he read a lot of English, but he didn't communicate in English very much. And my mother didn't -- so busy taking care of all of us kids that she had no time to go like women often do now. She was... and of course because the economic situation being so poor in the '30s, early '30s and all, she didn't make time or take time to learn English. So, of course, that's one of my biggest regrets, that my relationship with my mother was so brief in terms of our being able to communicate. I fault myself a great deal for not appreciating my mother more by not embracing the opportunity to learn Japanese. So I keep thinking now, even this late day when I'm pushing eighty-five years old, how was I able to communicate and develop any kind of relationship with my mother when we hardly talked? We did the best we could with her poor English, with my poor Japanese. But she was a devoted mother. And so, always so kind, sweet and gentle. Loved music, she was a good shamisen player, she played the koto, she loved to dance the odori, mostly Bon Odori during the summer months. And it was a joy to see her do that because she worked so hard all the time.",Pre-war background to the incarceration

114,"Sort of what I figured was typical of Issei parents, that Papa was the boss, Mama did all the work, and he had the last word. But my father was not stern that way, so I think she might have had it a little easier. He was not a bossy type. I think... isn't that strange? I don't remember a lot of the communication between the two of 'em, they must have had their own private moments.",Pre-war background to the incarceration

116,Okay.,Pre-war background to the incarceration
117,"Okay. So you were quite young, but do you recall kind of the differences between Sacramento and Los Angeles when you went? Was it quite a bit different or about the same?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
118,"No, it wasn't. Because in Sacramento, apparently, where we lived, was populated by a lot of Japanese American families. And so when we moved to Los Angeles, we also were in the middle of an area called, we called it the uptown area then, where there was the St. Mary's Episcopal Church run by Reverend John Yamasaki, and the Buddhist church there, and then there was a Japanese school, Daini Gakuen. There were a lot of Japanese American families there. So I didn't feel that great a difference in terms of discomfort. It's just making new friends, you know how kids are. I had a lot of neighbors who were Japanese Americans. So it was all right, transition.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
119,"And how about things like school? Was that about the same, from Sacramento to Los Angeles?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
120,"Yeah, and I don't remember much at all about school in Sacramento. But I was, I think we were something like third grade or thereabouts when I moved to Los Angeles. And because at that time we stuck with our own kind, I still, I think didn't feel racial animosity until I got more in high school, junior high and high school, when I started to feel the difference between us Asians, Asian Americans, and the white community. That's when I started to feel -- I think that's when most of us young folks feel that when we start thinking about maybe dating or ""going steady,"" you know, that's when usually the parents of the white girl or boy might object. Because I think racial discrimination was pretty prevalent, rampant at that time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
121,"When you look at your school, so elementary, junior high and high school, what were, like, the percentage of Japanese Americans in your schools or your class? Do you remember?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
122,"Because of the fact that there was a pretty good-sized Japanese American community, I can't tell you percentage-wise, in grammar school or junior high school. But when I went to high school, out of the class of about three hundred in my high school graduating class in 1942, I believe there were, in my class alone, were fifteen Japanese Americans out of the three hundred graduating students.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
123,I wanted to ask you about community events when you were growing up. Did you participate in Japanese community events in Los Angeles?,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Pre-war background to the incarceration
124,"Yeah. During those days, many of the young folks, say, high school age and college age, had established little cliques and clubs. And there were clubs with, oh, anywhere from, say, ten or a dozen, or maybe fifteen young girls or young boys who developed these little clubs. And then we would have a lot of baseball games, competing with other girls' teams, or once in a while, maybe competing against boys' teams. And they were scattered. I'm sure there were groups like that in San Pedro. I know there were several different groups in Los Angeles. I belonged to a group called the Junior Misses, and there were about a dozen of us. And we would, quote, ""sponsor"" dances just as an excuse to be able to meet the boys or have little bake sales. Any excuse to try to reach out and meet other people. Our group was concentrated in the uptown area. There was another group, young girls, called, I think, Debutantes, that was in the Crenshaw/Senshin area. And then there were boys' groups called Mustangs, Cougars, the Knights, K-N-I-G-H-T-S, and they would compete mostly baseball, sometimes basketball, volleyball. So that was... and then in the church, we would have Japanese language school, that was another occasion for us to be able to have co-ed activities. I belonged to the St. Mary's Episcopal Church, and as I recall, on Saturdays, we had Japanese language school, which I resisted terribly. Because during those days, not like today... today, you walk down the street, you can hear all kinds of languages, and people don't, you know, don't think twice about it. But during those days, you open your mouth and you spoke Japanese, you got dirty looks. So we tried to be so ""American,"" two hundred percent American, that there was reluctance on my part, anyway, and resistance to learn Japanese was a detriment to my development, especially my relationship with my parents.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
125,"I wanted to go back to those clubs, and especially the boys. When you had all these different clubs, did they ever get into fights or anything like that? Was there that kind of competition?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
126,"I didn't keep up too much with that, but I remember hearing that there was. And regionally, I think that the young boys' clubs in Los Angeles didn't get along with the San Pedro group, or the Terminal Island group. As a matter of fact, I think when we went into the camps, they would refer to each other as yogores. I'm not sure how you translate that in English, it means... yogore, of course, means ""dirty boys."" But anyway, there was not too much love lost, I heard. I had never, and I heard that even in Los Angeles, there were little competitive teams or groups that didn't get along. I guess they called them ""gangs"" instead of clubs.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
127,How about the girls' clubs? Did they ever compete against each other in different ways?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
128,"I don't recall any feeling of competition. There must have been, it's natural, when you think that young girls are competing for attention with each other and with boys particularly. I guess they existed, but I somehow didn't get that sense of real hostility or animosity. We were so busy doing our own thing that I don't recall that too much.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
129,"Now, in your club, the Junior Misses, did they have, like, different positions of authority? Like a president of the club and things like that? What was your -- the question, I guess, what was your role in the Junior Misses? Did you take a leadership role? Were you like a leader of the Junior Misses?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
130,"Isn't that strange? I can't even think whether we had a chairman or a president. We just all met periodically, maybe once or twice a month, and planned to maybe support a church activity or to try to sponsor some kind of sport event and make plans for dances. But I... you know, isn't that strange? I think there were a few girls who always sort of had the leadership quality, but I do not recall ever saying, ""Oh, she's the president of the club,"" or, ""She's treasurer of the club,"" and things like that. I think, I'm not sure if this is standard, but as I recall... I'll have to ask one of my, the few of us who are left to see if they recall.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
131,"In my notes, I have listed that you also spent a lot of time dancing. Can you describe your dancing, what kind of dancing you did?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
132,"Oh. Well, of course, there was always the jitterbugging, which was the rage at that time. I loved to do that. But I started to study more formal dancing, ballet, tap dancing, Spanish dancing, starting about the age of nine, ten. My father knew that I just loved music. My family was rather musical starting with my mother. And I don't know how they ever managed to pay for those classes. Because as I recall, we were always very poor, and I'm not sure how easy it was for my father to even come up with the rent for the house. And so when I think back, and they allowed me to take piano lessons and all these dance (classes), I wondered how much sacrifice they made to enable me to do that. I thought, well, during those days, dreaming, maybe I'll be the next Japanese Betty Grable or Eleanor Powell, or Ann Miller. And then I got into singing, which I enjoyed a lot, so I was able to start to learn to play the piano, accompany myself singing, but only at home.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
133,"Well, did your other siblings get the same opportunities to do music lessons or dancing lessons?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
134,"Yeah. I think my older sisters, they all played the piano. And my, Ei, the second daughter, she had a wonderful voice. And she also, I don't know where she learned it, but she started me on tap dancing. And she loved to do, during those days -- you're too young to know this -- the Charleston, there was a dance step that was very popular. She used to do that. She was very good at it. My brother played, my oldest brother played the violin very well. Aya did the piano, she always played Christian hymns, and Johnny was a good musician. Oh, my sister Ei also played a mean ukulele. She was good. And Johnny, he played the harmonica. [Laughs] And Amy was pretty (...) musical, she took some piano lessons, too. So we were offered the opportunity to enjoy the music. And my father was not musical, but he enjoyed it, and my mother was so, she loved it.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
135,"As a family, did you ever play together, music, like around the piano and sing together?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
136,"Oh, definitely. Especially we all used to get together, even in New York after the camps. We'd get together for the holidays, especially Christmas and Easter, Thanksgiving. And invariably, we all got around the piano. And because my sisters were good musically, they were able to harmonize. We made a pretty good team. We should have become... during those days, of course, we didn't cut any records, except very amateur things. But we were pretty good.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
137,"Now, when you would go to your friends' homes, or other relatives, and they had, on holidays, did you hear the same kind of singing that was in your home, or was your house maybe a little different?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
138,"You know, I don't recall ever going to somebody else's home, (...) my relatives' homes, where they did that. And we still do that whenever we do get together. We're still able to relive some of those musical moments in the family.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
139,"How large was the church in your growing up experience? I mean, how important was church to you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
140,"Well, I don't know how much it added to my spiritual life, but it was certainly a social gathering place. And I think it provided a place for Japanese Americans to feel comfortable with each other, and we had a good minister, Yamasaki, who was, John Yamasaki was, followed in the footsteps by his son. John, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps. And then I think they called him Father John, but that was after the camps. So I never got to get to know the younger minister. But it provided a sanctuary for the community, and a place for the Japanese community to meet regularly on Sunday. So I think it was a good thing to have for all of us in the Japanese American community to be able to know that here was one place that was good for us, comfortable for us, where we could keep in touch.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
141,"So during this time, you were doing things like dancing. And I'm just thinking of popular culture, which was very sort of white dominated. And the kind of movie stars and dancers you mentioned were white, and you wanted to be a dancer. And it seemed to be, perhaps, a very conflicted or confusing time for you to be in this larger popular culture, but yet being Japanese. Can you talk a little bit about that, sort of how that felt for you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
142,"Oh, yeah. Of course, living in a dream world, thinking I'd be the next Japanese well-known dancer or singer, it was a dream world. And it took me a long time to realize that it'll never be because of the atmosphere of that time, which was not open to non-whites to become famous in the entertainment world. And it was disheartening for me to continue. I dropped it in high school, all this dance class and all that, because I faced reality. ""It ain't gonna happen in my time, in my lifetime."" It's like my friend who was studying, who wanted to become a conductor of a symphony orchestra, and he was told, ""You're Japanese American. Forget it, do something else."" His heart was broken. Just because of what we look like. Even if I changed my name to ""Johnson"" or ""Smith,"" it wouldn't have done any good because of the way I look. And I finally came to that realization when I was in my high school, and it was heartbreaking. But I understood that that was -- I didn't understand it then, I was just resentful -- that that was the tenor of the time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
143,"And when you say ""resentful,"" who were you resentful towards?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
144,"I resent the whole white society for not accepting us as individuals with certain gifts or certain faults. But that we were considered so different that we would not be eligible to reach the heights that we wanted to individually. And it was a time of very strong racial prejudice against Asians, especially after World War II started, especially (against) Japanese Americans. But included prejudice against blacks, other Asians, Chicanos.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
145,"Yeah, so in this kind of climate, how did you, what did you feel about being Japanese? Was it something that you viewed as a positive, a negative? I mean, how would you view being Japanese?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
146,"Oh, I think I was denying my heritage, which is the reason I wanted to pursue my music career so much, that I think I secretly had hoped, ""I wish I were not Japanese."" And was made to feel that way, perhaps because of the societal pressures on us. I don't think all Japanese Nisei felt that way, but I had felt very strongly. Maybe it's because the particular line of career I wanted to pursue made me feel more that way. And it took many years before I... because I was in denial of my ethnic heritage, but it took many years before I learned to actually be proud of being of Japanese ancestry.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
147,"Do you recall your parents ever, or other relatives talking about Japanese and what that meant in a prideful way about being Japanese?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
148,"Gee, I don't think... because of my language barrier that we experienced, I don't think we ever talked about that. It might have helped.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
149,"Or maybe certain expectations that because you're Japanese, you should act a certain way?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
150,"Oh, definitely. That was, that was understood. First, you don't bring shame to your family, next, you don't bring shame to the relatives, and then to the community, Japanese American community. Because it's hard enough as it is, so you got to be the best you can in whatever field you like in school, or sport or whatever it is. You've got to be the best you can so you won't be made fun of.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
151,"And how did those values come through? How do you find out that you're supposed to be the best you can be, you don't bring shame? How does that happen?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
152,"Well, a little thing like a report card. Fortunately, I always got pretty good grades, so my father would be very pleased. And in terms of, say, citizenship, which is one of the subjects -- not subjects, but one of the characteristics of a student that shows up on a report card. All the Japanese Americans almost always had 'A's, because they toed the line. We were taught instinctively to respect authority, which meant teachers, doctors, policemen. And so... especially teachers. And my father was an education nut. He just felt that this country had so much to offer in terms of education, whether or not you're going to get a good job afterwards, but still, you had the opportunity to get educated. So he prized the school and educational system very strongly. So he was on top of us when it came to schoolwork. But just by not having conversations, but through a process of osmosis, we got these feelings of, ""Don't bring shame,"" ""Be good in what you do."" Never said, ""Be proud you're Japanese."" I don't think that was ever pushed in my family. I think he just said, ""You have to endure whatever it is,"" just unspoken.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

158,"I think I got something from a lot of different people. Nothing particularly... like I was also, in high school, what they call a schoolgirl. After high school classes, I'd go to a home and help the woman of the house, lady of the house wash dishes, make beds, vacuum the floor, help her prepare for dinner, something like that. I did that for a couple of years in high school. And I had a couple of very interesting women for whom I worked. One was a very strict German lady, and I thought, ""Oh, she was very strict."" But I learned a lot of little things from her. The proper way to set the table, the proper way to peel a tomato. And I used to wear a little apron with a little hat, lace hat, to serve. And I'd be waiting at the door of the kitchen while she would get a bell and ring it. ""Okay, bring the soup."" Then when the soup is finished, she'd ring the bell. I'd go in and pick up the soup and bring the entree or something. I learned little things that was helpful to me, as strict as she was. And then another lady I worked for was my French teacher, and she was very different. She was very friendly, and this was her way of helping me to learn a little bit of what French people do. So things like that. In terms of the Japanese Americans, I'm not sure I had looked up to anybody in particular. I think I got something from a lot of different people, whether they were my schoolmates or whether they were older. Isn't that, I'm glad you asked me that.

But there were those who we thought were friends, were wary of being close to us. I guess they were afraid of being considered ""Jap lovers,"" and the longer the period went after the war, that gap was, got bigger, and more people would react like they would rather not be close to us, if they were non-Japanese. But the neighbors, my close neighbors, were Japanese or they were blacks. And to them, it was, grateful, I was gratified. They didn't seem to consider us as enemies.

That was a blow, a big blow.

Washing three dozen diapers a day in a tub with a washboard, like there's no washing machine. For the pregnant woman like me, the food was not the best, I think. So I think most of the children who were born in camps like my daughter, had, at least the first growing up period, they were not really healthy. They didn't have the immune system developed that worked in if we had had better food. The hospital was run by a doctor, who I heard later on, not at that time, but later, from people who worked in the hospital, that the white doctor was an alcoholic.

As for the care, I think when I gave birth to my daughter, it was, we didn't have separate rooms. It was like a regular barrack, we all slept next to each other. And I guess I must have just thought, well, I'm lucky to have a hospital in which the baby was born. Nowadays, I think that women who give birth are asked to leave the hospital two or three days after birth. At that time, it was standard procedure that the new mother stayed in the hospital for a week, and that was what it was.

Of course, we had no idea he would be dying, so I thought, well, get a chance to see her once and then maybe when he came back, we would be, chance to get together.

Come to think of it, I never thought about the fact that when Jake finally joined me, what was their attitude about him? Isn't that funny? I hadn't even thought about that. I must try and reflect to see if I can reconstruct what the family's reaction was. I guess they thought we were just misguided kids, and they were right. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration
211,"I was going to ask, in terms of comparisons between Manzanar and Jerome, what were some of the differences between the two camps?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
212,"Well, first, it was the weather. Jerome did not have the storm, the dust storms that Manzanar had. And it was sweaty, it was muggy -- Jerome. But I think, I felt pretty comfortable because it was my own family. And by the time I got there, things had pretty much settled down. Whereas when we first went to Manzanar, everything was in a state of flux, we're trying to get used to our own environment, jobs were not available for people who just had nothing to do. By the time we got to Jerome, things were pretty much (like) the experience of Manzanar and other camps that were opened earlier, (which) taught the Jerome administration what to do, what not to do. So I think it was working pretty smoothly. And there were the regular Buddhist or church services, so that the residents of the camps felt more at ease than the first group of people like in Manzanar when I first went there. It was such a new environment, and the people in Jerome had come from other assembly centers like my parents were in Santa Anita first. So they already had a feeling of what it's like to live communally, lack of privacy. Anyway, it was a transfer for me just from one camp to another.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
213,"And do you have a sense in terms of just the... what's the right word? In terms of the tension -- I know Manzanar, especially in those early days, there was some unrest, I mean, there was some, they call them the ""Manzanar riots"" for instance, and things like that. And I didn't hear as much about Jerome in terms of unrest, and I was just wondering in terms of just the community attitudes, if you had a sense of any difference between Manzanar and Jerome.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
214,"Yeah. I never got involved very much with the so-called politics of either of the camps, but I did sense a better feeling of less unrest in Jerome. And, of course, I was still there when the so-called ""riot"" in Manzanar happened. And, of course, many, many years later, I became very friendly with Harry Ueno, who was supposed to be the catalyst for that particular disturbance. But in Jerome, I think, to show the difference, Jerome had only one dissident camp resister, Joe Yamakido, whereas Manzanar had more, and, of course, Heart Mountain had a lot, and Granada had more. But I think the fact that you had just one draft resisters shows sort of the tenor of the atmosphere and environment of Jerome as compared to, say, Heart Mountain. So I guess it was a little quieter.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
215,"You mentioned how your husband Jake eventually joined you, but then you said he went into the army from there?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
216,"Yeah, he was drafted.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
217,Okay. And so what service did go to?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
218,"Well, he went to Camp Blanding, and then he was sent to Germany. But he never talked about it, so I don't know if it was part of the 442 or where did the Nisei who were trained in Camp Blanding; were they integrated into the 442? Do you know? I'm not sure.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

220,"No, I'm not sure.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
221,"But now I'm thinking about your relationship. I mean, here you got married, you eloped right before you went to Manzanar, then once you got to Manzanar, there was no privacy, and then you became pregnant and had a child. And then you were separated from your husband because you went to Jerome to be with your sick father for several months. And then he comes just for a short time and then goes to the army. So what happened to the relationship? It seemed like it never really had much of a chance.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
222,"Yeah. It was only during the period we were in Manzanar that we had a steady time together. And it became apparent after a while that the chemistry wasn't right. But at that time, in Manzanar, I had no idea that we would separate. But because of the long separation and because of all the little personal circumstances that happened later, after he came back from Germany, it just didn't go well, so we decided to split. So at that point, after we got divorced, I joined my family in New York, because most of my family went to New York because my sister was living there already. And my brother still lives in New York, my younger sister still lives in New York, so a good part of my family had relocated out of the camps to the East Coast, so I went there. So I lived in New York for thirty years, less five years when I was in Japan.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
223,And when were you in Japan?,Life after removal and during the incarceration

225,"So let me see if I can summarize this. So from Jerome, you went directly to New York?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
226,"No, from Jerome I went to, while Jake was still in Germany, I went to Denver, Colorado for several months, because part of the Miyazaki family, my in-laws, were living there. They said, ""Come out here, 'cause it's nice in Denver."" So I went to Denver, but I just didn't dig it. I just wasn't comfortable, I didn't care for it. And so I said, ""No, I think I'll just pick up, go back to California."" And without any, it just shows how stupid and non-thinking, and didn't consider the future. I just picked up with Geri and a few suitcases and went to, came to Los Angeles without even knowing, when I left, where I was gonna sleep when I got here. [Laughs] And by sheer coincidence, when I reached here and I checked into a hotel, Geri. (...) I decided to go to the Relocation (office of) the War Relocation Authority relocation office, to see what available facilities I could look into, apartment or something like that. And on the way, I met one of my in-laws, and he said, ""Hey, what you doing here?"" I said, ""Well, I decided to move from Denver to here."" He said, ""Where are you going to stay?"" I said, ""I don't know, I'm just going to find out."" ""Then come home with me, and we'll put you up."" Holy Moses, what luck. I had, born with a silver spoon in my mouth, I thought. Well, they were so kind to me and they took me in, and I was one of, I think, twenty-one in a three-bedroom house. We took turns, as I recall, sleeping, eating. But this family was so generous and wanted to help way beyond the call of duty. This sister-in-law of mine and her husband had three kids. They had Ted's father, mother, brother, and a daughter, and two brothers and me and Geri. I think there were about twenty, twenty-one of us. And we just made do. I don't know how we did it, but they were amenable, friendly, respectful of each other. Imagine. All one related family. Such generosity. He said, ""Come home with me.""

At that time, before tape recorders became the easy way to record things, the stenotype institute taught people how to use this very condensed, abbreviated typewriter-like (instrument), where you had to learn the combination of keys for the missing keys to take dictation or to take speeches at conventions, which I learned to do. And I was working to take speeches at conventions, or get hired out from this institute to a letter shop, where I would be rehired by, say, lawyers who worked in that building to take dictation and do temporary work.

I said, ""Yeah."" ""Are you Japanese?"" ""Yeah, my parents are from Japan."" ""I don't want you. Tell your boss to send me someone else, not Japanese."" I was shocked. I had never had somebody tell me right to face, because I'm Japanese, ""I'm not going to use you."" Didn't know what I could do, what I couldn't do. I was really devastated at that. Well, I took this course and I graduated, so I got some work as a court reporter, but I never had to go to court.

So my actual contact with the Japanese people was pretty limited mostly to my housemaids, the gardener, and just a few Japanese friends. Because of the restrictions, I didn't get a chance to really, I didn't take advantage of it. Maybe I could have done more, to even learn the language. It seemed like it slipped out of my hands, but I think now I should have somehow taken advantage of being there much more. I liked it very much, although I know I was treated like a gaijin, because they could tell by the way I talked, or walked, or the way I dressed, I was not a Japanese-Japanese. But it was nice to be there in the land of my parents. I didn't get a chance at that time, because of the restriction, to visit my own parents' families, but I did go back in 1992, I guess it was, for the first time, to visit Kumamoto and Hiroshima at the time.

By the time, when we first went there, it was still, the country was still reeling from the aftereffects of the devastation, and there were little kids with no shoes walking hadashi, barefoot, (...) and people with not enough food or clothing. But by the time we left, 1954, it was just amazing to see how much the Japanese had picked themselves up and took advantage of the opportunities (arose) whenever it appeared.

I compare that with the European countries that were so negatively affected by World War II, how long it took them to come up from all this devastation, and how quickly the Japanese did.

And they used the word ""social health"" because they thought it would turn off the public if they use what actually we were involved in, which was education (about) venereal diseases. As ASHA, American Social Health Association, we were part of a larger group called the International Union Against Venereal Diseases and Treponematosis. [Laughs] IUVDT, yeah, that's right.

But then the black movement and Martin Luther King and Kennedys and all those things started happening, I started to think more about it. And when I was invited to join the AAA, come listen to what they had to say, just a meeting, informal meeting, I was really struck by my ignorance about political systems, about racism, things I hadn't given much thought to, really deep thought to.

286,"Well, actually, I met him in Japan. It's interesting that you ask that. [Laughs] Because he, Jack happened to belong to the same CIC unit, the Counterintelligence Corps unit that my then-husband belonged to, which was headquartered in Kyoto, but the sub-branch was in Otsu, where we lived. And so we used to see a lot of each other during that time, and we were all friendly. We used to join each other at the officer's club and have dinner at each other's homes. Then when Jack and his family left Japan in the summer of '54, and just at that time, we were transferred from the Kyoto area to Nagoya. So we were in Nagoya from early spring or summer to the end of '54, December, when we came back to the United States. And we had exchanged, our families stayed in touch, we exchanged Christmas greetings and things like that. But, and then all of a sudden, in 1976, when I was in New York, living in Manhattan, I get this call from Jack saying, ""Hi, this is Jack. I'm downstairs."" [Laughs] So how many years? Twenty years or... '54, '64... yeah, twenty-something years had gone by. ""Oh, Jack. Okay."" So it turned out that he had separated from his wife, and eventually his wife passed away anyway, she was very sick. But it was twenty-something years, and we picked up the... there was something right about, there's, nothing happened in Japan, but all those years, we just sort of stayed in touch. And it was, so it seemed like, ""Oh, haven't seen you since yesterday,"" kind of feeling. I think when the chemistry is right, that kind of feeling prevails. So it was that many years. [Laughs] We decided to get married. 'Cause I'd been, by that time, I'd been separated for fifteen more years or so, longer than that, when Davis said he wanted to get remarried, so can we be divorced? We had been separated the umpteen years. I said, ""Sure.""",Life after removal and during the incarceration

300,"Oh, well, I didn't do anything for a while, but then I decided I'd like to know what kind of information the FBI had on me for having marched in the streets in New York, anti-Vietnam War demonstration and all that. So I wondered if the FBI had anything on me, so I went down and they said, ""No, we don't have anything. Maybe New York office has, but nothing."" And I decided, ""Well, I want to find out what they have in terms of the camp life on my family."" So that started me out. And by that time, I had already met Michi Weglyn and got to know her pretty well in New York for the last two years or so before I moved down there. So I told her I was gonna find out about my family. She said, ""Well, yeah, look at some of my footnotes, and if you're interested, follow."" So after that, I found out about my family, the information they had, 'cause it's quite extensive. And then I started looking into the camp situation, because the archivists were all so helpful. They said, ""We have such wonderful stuff here, nobody's looking at it. Not enough people."" They knew Michi and Roger Daniels were looking at it, but very few (other writers, scholars and researchers).",Life after removal and during the incarceration
301,"Oh, right, okay. Well, Jack was still working when I first started doing archival work, but then he did retire, so he wanted something to do. So I asked him if he would pick up on the archival work searching for information for the Commission on Wartime Relocation. And so, oh, he was very happy to do it. And the more he learned about it, the more incensed he got at his own country. And he got -- I might have mentioned this in a previous interview, but he became incensed at the idea that here he was in his paratroop role, paratrooper role, fighting the enemy, Japan, for our constitutional guarantees, the freedom, liberty, equal opportunity, equality under the law, and at the same time, we were being mistreated, we American citizens. And the more he thought about it, the more he thought, ""Gee, we were fighting for principles, and I lost so many good friends, fighting for principles that we were not living up to ourselves."" And it just made him so mad that he got into this archival research of an injustice against the Japanese American community like a bulldog. So he helped me dig out things. I would ask him to look at certain records that I didn't have a chance (to see). He would look it up, and we would Xerox these copies to give to the Commission, so that they could come up with their recommendations (to) Congress. Then we were asked by the National Council for Japanese American Redress, William Hohri's group, to do research for them because they were planning to file a class action lawsuit. So Jack helped me on that, because I was tied up with the Commission office a lot. So he helped me to pull together the things that would be helpful to the class action lawsuit. Then the coram nobis lawyers said they could use some help, too. So Jack helped me, and we tried to help the coram nobis cases do the research. And just about the same time, the Smithsonian was planning to open up its exhibition on Japanese Americans. What was it? ""A More Perfect Union: Japanese Americans and the United States Constitution,"" and they asked me and Jack to be consultants on the content of the exhibition. So we were busy helping the curator on that. Then after the bill was passed for Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the Justice Department asked Jack and me to be the consultant on locating all eligible people for redress. So we were involved with that, to especially locate (and verify names) of people who applied for redress but (whose) names weren't on official records. We were able to direct the Justice Department to the master list, which was the most useful one, listed everybody who was in the ten camps, and those who were in the internment camps, which was different, of course. So we were able to locate rosters and names of those who were in the internment camps. And especially for people who applied, but whose name didn't appear, they asked us to find. So Jack was involved with me every step of the way.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
302,"That's good. And another piece that I've come across is work around the ""magic cables,"" which is where his counterintelligence background, I think, helped in interpretation of that.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
303,"I'm now going to switch gears. I'm not going to ask you questions about your archival work because it's well-documented in other places, especially the, I think what you call were the nuggets that you found as a researcher like the first edition of DeWitt's Final Report would be an example of that. But it's been pretty well-documented that your, the work that you did was really important to not only the coram nobis and also the redress, but just in terms of uncovering lots of information that was really helpful to scholars about what really happened during World War II. And I'm just curious in terms of your role and how you, when you look back at it, you had such a pivotal role. What do you attribute that to? I mean, why were you the person who was so key in finding so much?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
304,"Well, I have to say, I was, I guess my training and my experience made me look at a lot of the little trees, not just the forest, but the details, and to try to connect dots. But in many cases, if it were not for the input of other people like in the coram nobis case, for example, since I don't have a legal background, I could only trust my intuition that a particular document was important, and that I had to count on those good minds, Dale Minami, Don Tamaki, who comprised the coram nobis law teams, to connect the dots for me. So without the help of those people, and like in William Hohri's case, Ellen Carson, the lawyer, for whom we, Jack and I, dug up information, and Angus Macbeth, the special counsel, for him to recognize that certain memos or certain reports were key to creating the report to convince the President and Congress, that this group of people were mistreated. For all these people, not myself alone. It took a lot of people who knew more than I did, or who had the wisdom and the training to be able to attach the importance and connect the facts that made it possible for me to get too much credit, really. If it weren't for all these people who did the thinking, a lot of the thinking.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
305,"But let me, let me make sure I understand this. 'Cause when I talked to some of these others, they said in terms of constructing the story, but it wasn't like they were trying to construct the story, and then they called you, Aiko, and said, ""So, Aiko, can you find this document or this document?"" it was more of a matter that you uncovered things that were really powerful, and then had enough knowledge to say, ""Oh, this is probably important,"" and you then gave it to them. And it was this really rich source of materials that they said, ""Oh my gosh, with this material, we can now construct the story."" I think, wouldn't you say that that was the case, more?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
306,"I have to say, I think it took more -- I think I was fortunate enough to have come across certain documents that brought light to a particular subject, but it took somebody else with a different mind to interpret it in such a way as to be beneficial to either the coram nobis case, or to the Commission report, or to the class action lawsuit. So I don't want too much credit given to me. Just the fact that I did find, for example, the first version of the DeWitt report, that, I must say, it was good that I recalled certain things that pointed to the fact that there was a first version. And so what is it that the Supreme Court in 1944 relied upon in order to convict Korematsu, for example? I said maybe this is it. It was intuitive. But legally, I didn't know, and it took, it took the coram nobis people and Angus Macbeth to say, ""Ah, racism, this proves injustice on the part of a general in the army, plus falsehoods of facts."" So it took other minds to bring out the importance of what I did find, but I must say, I was glad I had remembered certain facts that called my attention to the possible importance of this thing.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
307,"But when you think of the work you did in terms of the... I look through the reports and things, and the enormity. I mean, I've been in archives before, and it's not a nice and tidy type of work. I mean, it's opening boxes, looking through things, and it's so easy to miss something or not look at something, and realize the importance of it. It is almost like looking and finding the needle in a haystack sometimes in terms of looking at this. And I'm wondering, in terms of what happened especially in the '80s, with the coram nobis or redress, I mean, it's pretty clear to me, without some of these key documents, it would have been very difficult to have made the case. How, as a community, how close were we not to finding some of these documents? I mean, how, I mean, when I listen, I talk to Peter Irons sometimes, he says, he'll call it outright luck sometimes.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
308,"Oh, yes.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
309,"That when he met you and his example of getting lucky, and how lucky were we as a community that all these pieces came together?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
310,"That's right. I consider it lucky, too. And if it weren't for the fact that I had met Peter, and the fact that Peter had discovered many documents, and especially a few key documents that connected what I found to what he found. So it took, it took us as a team to do that, and it was luck of the Irish, luck of the Japanese, I guess, that I saw this one report sitting on this archivist's desk. Ah, you know, I didn't recognize it right away, but as soon as I opened, it, wow. I said, ""Pow, this is it."" And it was luck, it was luck. If I hadn't walked in that day, it might not have been there. And if I hadn't happened to know about the first version having taken place, just a few weeks before I think I happened to read the file on it, I would not have recognized it. So it was a coming together of all these fortunate instances that made it possible.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
311,"I think so. I agree with you, and that was why I took it upon myself to do what some people call unnecessary extra work. But I documented everything I got exactly where it, what file, what box, what record group and everything else, so that when the Commission wrote its report, people couldn't say, ""How can that be?"" Here's proof officially written by top government, top government, here's proof. So it took a lot of extra time on my part, and I know people were saying, ""Oh, you're just so piddly about details."" But that helped to augment and strengthen the report so people couldn't deny it.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

And in the '80s, Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 apologizing and sort of authorizing payment to Japanese Americans. The coram nobis cases, where, as you mentioned earlier, they vacated the convictions of Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi and Min Yasui. So did we accomplish that? Are we, did we make... I guess the question is, is that enough? I mean, did we accomplish, did you and others accomplish what they were after?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
320,"Not totally. I think just the fact that some of the story will be now included in our history books in school is a good step forward. But -- and this goes back to 1984 or so, or '85, maybe -- when to prove a point that, how much have we accomplished or was it worth it? I was on a television show with, I think Norman Mineta was one of the panel members. But there was a congressman, Norman Shumway from California, who was on the screen. He couldn't appear at the studio, but they got him on the screen. We were talking about the redress bill that was being debated, and he said, what comes back to me all the time to show how the, at least Congress was viewing the redress bill. He said, ""If you think for one moment that this bill, redress bill, which calls for 1.2 billion dollars, (...) is going to make any difference in the way the government will react in times of emergency such as after Pearl Harbor, that we have to take action against a potential enemy, you think it's going to make any difference that the government will not pick up a group of, say, misfits or ethnic group, then you're barking up the wrong tree. Don't kid yourself."" He says, ""We spend more than a billion dollars every day, every minute, every hour,"" he said. ""So this isn't going to make a dent."" I was furious with him when he said that, but it turned out to be the truth. When the war broke out after 9/11 and this country started picking on Arab Americans just because they were Arab Americans, ooh, shades of deja vu. We didn't learn anything. And what made me think was, okay, if Hohri vs. U.S., the class-action lawsuit that would cost the government, the treasury, 27 billion dollars, if we had passed that, would this country have remembered? I'm wondering whether or not the bottom line on this in this country is always the almighty dollar. Yes, we got an apology, a letter of apology from Bush and Clinton, and twenty thousand dollars per survivor. But Congress, even the new members of Congress (today) don't know anything about it. We didn't make a dent, we didn't affect how this country was looking at Arab Americans after 9/11. So I'm thinking, what do we have to do to make Americans aware? The only thing I see, the plus in our experience, is that now some of the stories of the 442 Regimental Combat Team, our exclusion, incarceration, will be in the history books. Maybe that's a start. But, well, jiminy, it's how many years since this happened, and we still, you know, don't know enough, and we repeated the same mistake when 9/11 happened. What do we have to do to awaken this country? I have questions about that.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

But I'm thinking in terms of the man who was responsible for writing the report to Congress, Angus Macbeth, who was the Special Counsel on the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, and Bob Bratt, Robert Bratt, who was the first administrator for the Office of Redress Administration of the Justice Department, and Ellen Carson and the firm of Landis, Cohen, Rao, Asalanco, who pressed for a judicial response, not just congressional, legislative, (but) for judicial response on the constitutionality of what happened in the wartime period to Japanese Americans. And the coram nobis lawyers... well, the coram nobis lawyers had been recognized quite well, but those other people... and individuals like Rita Takahashi, who was the JACL representative in Washington, D.C. during the very active redress period. She was (such) a rock and did so much, and I don't know if anybody knows about all the work she did. There's so many people who should be recognized for their strength and continued work and support that they had given. There's Tom Crouch, who was the curator in the Smithsonian of the Japanese American exhibition. He was fantastic, and he just got to the crux and the heart of the issues very quickly, and displayed whatever artifacts he had in a stunning manner. He had the world in his heart, he was very good.

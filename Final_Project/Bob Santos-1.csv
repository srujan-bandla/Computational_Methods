On camera is Dana Hoshide, observing we have Casey Ikeda and Nina Wallace, and I'm the interviewer, Tom Ikeda. And so, Bob, the first interview we covered pretty much the prewar and wartime, and to start this interview off, during the war your father lost his eyesight, so why don't we start right there and tell me about that?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2266,"Okay, we lived in the NP Hotel, and my dad had this girlfriend. I don't know if they were married or not. When you're a little kid you don't, you're not really that... I'm living with my aunt and uncle, and I'd come down on weekends, live with my dad. So he had this girlfriend, and he was going to a doctor, and his eyesight on... his one eye, he lost sight of one eye while still boxing, and then the other eye, his left eye, started to deteriorate, so he went to the doctor and had that checked out. And they told him that we should try cataract surgery, and so he -- he didn't know much about it, and he did a little research on it and figured that that was the right way to go to save that, the left eye -- so he had the surgery, and it failed. He lost both eyes, sight in both eyes. So his girlfriend left, and so he was, he was pretty much on his own except when I came after school or on weekends to take him around. And I became my dad's seeing eye dog. So Saturday or Sunday, I'd go down Saturday morning and we had this ritual. We would, I would take my dad -- he'd get dressed up. He always wore a shirt and a tie and a suit. And as I said earlier, we lived in this one room, single room occupancy unit, nine by thirteen, and there was this closet and the closet had all his clothes, and when he was boxing he acquired a pretty nice wardrobe, and so he always dressed in a suit. So I'd take him around the Chinatown-International District -- and don't forget, I'm ten, eleven years old then -- and we'd go by the barbershop on Jackson Street, Vince's Barbershop, and we'd stop in the barbershop, and you could hear the rattling of the domino chips in the back, in the back room where they're playing haikyu. Paikyu, they call it now. And we'd go in the back and the guys that were winning would give me a little money. I always had money in my pocket. And we'd go in the back room and I'd get a nickel or a dime from the winners, right, and my dad would get a cigar from these guys, and then we'd go down and go into Delphine's barbershop. That's in the Atlas Hotel, where one of the restaurants are now, and it was Delphine's barbershop and it was the biggest barbershop in Chinatown. They had six chairs, three on each side. And in the back room you could hear the click, click, click, so I'd bring my dad there and made, oh, I might've made twenty-five, thirty-five cents going around, talking to the winners, and my dad was still a hero, sports hero, even though he had quit boxing seven, eight years before that. And we'd leave Delphine's barbershop and then we'd pass Ray's barbershop, and I said, ""Dad, why don't we go in there?"" he says, ""We're Tagalog and they're Ilocano.""

We either went to breakfast early at the Jackson Cafe or the Paramount Cafe that was on Jackson, or if it was closer to lunch we went and got hum bow at Tai Tung. And we'd sit there and I'd say, ""Dad, you have to take the paper off the bottom."" He'd say, ""Bobby, I know that. I knew this before you were born.""

Mike's Tavern was on the corner of Sixth and King, on the south, on the southeast corner of Sixth and King. It's a brick building now owned by Howard Dong. And he said, ""I want to go see my friend Felix. He's having a beer today."" So we walk into the tavern. You know my dad had a cane. Tap, tap, tap, tap, so everybody knew he was coming, tap, tap. We walk in, and as soon as we walk in the door of the tavern we hear this argument going on, these two guys yelling at each other, and one of 'em is Felix, my dad's friend. And someone, either him or the guy that he was arguing with, the big Swedish guy, Nordic American guy, were arguing over this five dollar loan or bet, whatever it was, and we sat down and they were still arguing, and Dad said, ""Bobby, take me over to that fellow that's talking to Felix.""

The dining hall also was used in the evening as a gambling hall, so some of these sharp gamblers would get their way up to Alaska and become the dealers at these gambling, at the gambling tables. And a lot of these guys, a lot of these cannery workers would lose their whole check, their whole season's salary in a week, and that was part of life.

It always bothered me that they were termed ""hotshot jitterbugs"" because they dressed different from all the other kids at school. The white kids, right? And so I wrote about that in my book, I think, about, you learn these little things about little, just little things and it bothered you, little comments that were made about people, brown people, black people, and so it starts to sink in that there's two different worlds here as you're growing up.

I was thinking about school 'cause I had the GI Bill, but I was in the middle of the school, it was in October and it was after the semester started, so I went back to Boeing and got a job in the, called the hammer shop. They had these big SECO hammers, lead hammers, and you have a flat piece of metal, and the hammer came down to shape the metal, right, and it formed the metal to the shape of the die. And so that was a fun thing to do. And then in that shop they had these rope hammers and the heavy hammerhead came down with the die on it, come down slowly, and then across the aisle were these siegal hammers that were used hydraulically, and they came down hard, like boom. You had to go like this and they'd go [moves arm up and down] and then boom. And I was, I became a hammer operator after the first, after the first year, actually, I made my way up from a B operator to A operator within a year, so I really started making some money. I'd get these raises every other week, seems like twice, twice a month I'd get raises. So this one guy, this old guy, a Nordic American guy who had been there for years, he was a shop steward and he was the jitney driver, and he was just livid that this young kid was making more money than he was making at that time. And I had to have a die brought in to the hammer once and I had to call him, Gus or whatever his name was, and I had to lead him in with this die that's dangling from a jitney, right, on a cable, and it's several hundred pounds, maybe a ton even, and it swaying like this. And he's going by me, and he stops and it starts to sway, and it hits me, right? The die hits me, not hard, but just enough to piss me off, and I, this had been going on for about a month or so, this antagonism between him and I, him really, really mad at me. But so when he hit me, instinctively, I grabbed him off the jitney and I hit him, and he went flying into a bin full of cut up aluminum scraps. And when I hit him I probably hit over here somewhere [points to head], right, and he went in there, and then when I saw the photos when I, when they arrested me and brought me to trial, he's all cut up. It wasn't from me, it was from the, from the metal scraps in that bin that he got cut up, and so I had to, went to trial of course, and I subpoenaed all my coworkers and they stuck up with me, for me. They said this guy had caused me trouble for a whole month and then I just retaliated. And I got, I got convicted, but they, there was no sentencing. They put me on probation for a year, if I stayed out of trouble, so I did that.

I was an A hammer operator, and they, they took my A rating away and gave me a B rating. I could still be a hammer operator, but I lost a little bit of money, salary range went down, and so I decided I was going the wrong way, so I was looking for another job and decided, I had joined a Catholic fraternal organization called the Knights of Columbus. And it was, when I was a member of the Knights of Columbus, it has a really nice insurance program, too, life insurance program, so the director of the insurance program asked me if I wanted to work for him, selling insurance, and I said sure, I'd leave Boeing. I loved that work, but I decided I was going the wrong way, so I hired on as an insurance salesman for the Knights of Columbus and did pretty well, but it wasn't really what I wanted to do. My heart wasn't into it. And so I was hired by another member of the Knights of Columbus, a guy named Bill Herr, to work in his lumber yard. He had four or five lumberyards scattered around the Puget Sound area, and so he hired me and made me the manager of his little store in Everett called the Caboose. It was right by the railroad tracks and I was manager of this lumberyard up in Everett for a couple years. And then I was reassigned to Skyway, the lumberyard in Skyway, and it's the same time I'm starting to get involved in civil rights movement. And I, from the Knights of Columbus I met a guy named Walter Hubbard, and he was an activist in the black community and happened to be also, happened to be a leader in the black Catholic community, and so he, he talked me... let's take a little break here.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2349,"So Walter Hubbard was, he was president of the Catholic Interracial Council of Seattle. And at that time we had an archbishop, Archbishop Thomas Connolly, and he was becoming a champion in the Civil Rights Movement locally, with the local clergy, and so the Catholic Interracial Council of Seattle was born. [Coughs] Excuse me, start over again. Seattle became pretty prominent in the Civil Rights Movement because Archbishop Thomas A. Connolly is, his heart was in the Civil Rights Movement. And Walter Hubbard started the Seattle chapter of the Catholic Interracial Council with the blessing, you might say, of the archbishop. The Catholic Interracial Council would be the civil rights arm of the archdiocese. It's not officially, but it'd be an arm. And so there were a couple of demonstrations, a couple of meetings about the movement, Civil Rights Movement, and how the Catholic Church should be, locally, should be involved in the, in this struggle for civil rights. And we're talkin' about the mid '60s. Walter came up to me one day and said, ""Bob, the Catholic Interracial Council's gonna sponsor this march on open housing."" It was a march on supporting legislation for open housing that would allow blacks and other minorities to purchase housing anywhere in the city of Seattle. Seattle, in all these neighborhoods in Seattle there were these covenants where owners of the homes did not have to, they didn't want to sell their homes -- when they were, time to sell it -- to people of color, or Jews or, these covenants were very restrictive on who you could sell your property to. So the open housing movement became strong, and Walter said, Bob, come to the march. So I says, okay, I guess I -- Walter's my drinking buddy, so I said okay. So I go to the march. It's at St. James Cathedral, and Walter says, ""Bob, why don't you hold this pole, this banner? There'll be another guy holding it over there and you don't have say nothing. You don't have to sing, you don't have to say anything. Just hold the banner as we march."" And it was a November afternoon and it was rainy and windy, and I'm struggling to hold this damn banner, right, and I don't dare, I mean, I don't dare drop it, but it's really heavy 'cause it's blowing. And none of the other guys around, these beautiful Catholic people, they weren't willing to take it from me, right? 'Cause they knew it was gonna be, anyway, after that, after that march ended at the cathedral, all I could think of, I'll never join one of these marches again, ever. So I said, Walter, that was really mean, all this kind of stuff. He says, ""You did a good job."" So the next morning in the front page of the paper, of the Catholic paper, here I am holding the banner, Bob Santos, Catholic Interracial Council. I said, hey, that's pretty cool.

That was their meeting place. And it was an organization called CARITAS; it was Community Action, Remedial Instruction, Tutoring, and Assisted Service, CARITAS. And it was a tutoring, a tutoring school that was funded by the state, and the responsibility of CARITAS was to match up students that were in a remedial program one on one with either high school seniors or college students so they'd get one to one tutoring to help them out in their schoolwork. So this old St. Peter Claver Center was the old Maryknoll school where I went to school and as a teenager hung out at St. Peter Claver Center at the dances and stuff, so it was like me returning home attending these meetings at the auditorium at St. Peter Claver Center, Catholic Interracial Council.

So we go to the trailer, and the construction workers, they were all throughout the building, they all come down to the second level and they're yellin' at us -- they're all white -- they're yelling at us and giving us the finger and throwing little pieces of wood down at us.

Lot of Asians, again, Dolores Sibonga and her husband, and all these Catholic priests and nuns were, we all went out to SeaTac. And what we did is we went from one concourse -- we're still, we're not allowed to go outside, but we went from one concourse to the other. The sheriffs were out there at, on the tarmac and they'd be monitoring us, and when we'd move down the concourse to another end of the airport they had to run twice as far to get around to the other end where we ended up. So finally we filtered our way down to the tarmac and we were singin' like, [sings] ""We shall overcome,"" and airplanes were goin' over and all hell was breaking loose. The sheriff's department had to call in all the police departments from Federal Way and Renton and Fife and Kent and every, and it became like an armed camp. And we were running the sheriff's department people crazy. In the meantime, Jim Takasaki and a Central Area Contractors Association, they were lining up for tickets at the ticket counters, and there would be a bunch of them, right, so that the regular people that wanted to buy tickets to go on flights, they were at the end of the line. And Jim and them guys would take out their credit cards, they said, no, I think, no, I don't want to use this one, I'll use this one.

That's not proper dress for school attire. You have to have your hair cut."" And so there was this big occupation of Franklin High School by Larry Gossett and some of his folks from the Black Student Union, and so they disrupted the whole afternoon, and the students, the black students came into the auditorium to hear Larry Gossett and the only teacher to show up with the students was a guy name Bob Maestas, a teacher at Franklin High School, history teacher. And that was Roberto, and it was from there that Larry and Roberto became very close, right after that. They had met a couple, Roberto started attending more of the meetings and the demonstrations and the rallies, that kind of stuff, and became very militant. Roberto became very militant, quit the school and brought a bunch of Latinos together, and after Bernie occupies Fort Lawton, Roberto occupies the vacant school, Beacon Hill School, to be used as a cultural center for the Latino population. It was about two months before Roberto occupies Beacon Hill School that Larry Matsuda, John Eng, and some Asian guys got together, were planning the occupation of Beacon Hill School for Asian, for an Asian community center.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2394,"This was during his kickoff event, and it was one of the very first times I remember that an Asian group was out in public picketing or involved in a demonstration against a private white club. And that picked up quite a bit of publicity, particularly in the Asian community because finally the Asians were involved in a movement. Well, we were saying all along the Filipinos were involved in the movement at the, during the United Farm Workers boycott, walkout of the fields of California in the mid '60s. It was the Filipino farm workers who first walked out of the fields before Cesar Chavez, and when they walked out Cesar Chavez joined them and they formed the United Farm Workers association. So Asians were involved very early on. Indian fishing rights, we're telling the other, blacks and Latinos, ""We've been involved for many years, even before now, but we're really joining forces with you."" Seattle was --",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2395,"And prior to that, I'm curious, was there, what's the right word, a push from the black or the Latino community to the Asians, like, ""Hey guys, you guys have to get more in the game. I mean, we're out there doing things. Where are you?"" Was there any of that talk going on?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2396,"That might've been internally, but this is, we're talking about the same era, the Black Panthers, the United Construction Workers meeting at St. Peter Claver Center, the Oriental, ACE, Asian Coalition for Equality were meeting there, and the Asian activists were joining the Latino activists, the Asian activists were joining Tyree Scott. Michael Woo, Doug Chin, I forgot his name, Steve Locke, Steve Louie, they were, they were also going out on the marches that Tyree Scott was organizing for the construction workers, so the Asians started to get involved in that movement, and then the Asians started to show up at Fort Lawton when Bernie was occupying that fort. And so you saw a lot of the Asian activists starting to support other ethnic demonstrations, other movements. So Seattle was very unique in that happening, 'cause much of the meetings were at St. Peter Claver Center, so if you had the Asian Coalition for Equality meeting and then you had United Construction people meeting and then they joined forces for various events, demonstrations, rallies, and so it became a multiracial movement.

So that first group that went to the Elks Club, they formed this Coalition Against Discrimination, and it brought in the American Jewish Committee. It brought in all the, the Oriental Student Union, the Asian Coalition for Equality, Filipino Coalition for Equality, and a lot of fringe groups, and they formed this group to fight the discriminatory practices of all these private clubs, including the Washington Athletic Club, the Rainier Club, the Elks, the Eagles, the Moose.

And we're talking about using the organization that was formed by the business community called InterIm, International District Improvement Association. Starting, we should start attending those meetings that InterIm was holding. InterIm was started by the property owners, the business owners, as a quasi chamber of commerce. Tomio Moriguchi and Shigeko Uno, Terry Toda, Don Chin, they started InterIm, and we, the Asian activists, we started attending their meetings. InterIm was funded in part, we got a contract from the Model Cities Program. It was a federal program. Money came from the federal government to the city of Seattle to talk about issues within a sector of Central Area and downtown Seattle that included the International District, so the federal funds were coming into the city to fund community groups within that model city boundary. In the International District we were part of that boundary, so we said we're eligible for some of this money.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

So the vote, the vote to fund the first, to fund, the vote to fund InterIm came out fourteen to fourteen. It was a tie vote, 'cause most of the, most of the blacks were saying the Asians don't have any problems. That's when that first came out. So the chairman of the Model City Program there was Judge Charles Johnson, and he voted to oppose the funding, and I could have killed him, but he was a judge, right? So we woke up to the fact that, it's okay, we're not gonna get funding, but we really have to be in a position to educate the black community and other ethnic communities on the plight of the neighbors and the people in the International District who would be displaced with all this development that's going on. People didn't understand it. Everybody thought if, and now, it's now that the Kingdome is being planned and the idea of construction of this multipurpose Kingdome, people outside the community said, ""Well, it's gonna help your community.

He didn't want me running the show down there.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2413,"But going back to this, this whole InterIm, and I'm curious about some of the more longstanding Japanese American communities, like the JACL. Were they at all involved with civil rights and some of these activism movements during this time?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2414,"There were individuals, but not so much as an organization. They were sort of standing apart. I wasn't a member of JACL, so I don't know what was happening internally, but you had Tomio and all these folks that were a part of JACL, Shigeko, and at their meetings they must've been discussing what was happening with InterIm and the new crop of young activism that were involved in trying to preserve the community.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2415,"Especially when you think about, their stated mission is civil rights, here we were in the midst of the largest civil rights movement in Seattle, and I'm just curious, where were they during this time?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2416,"They weren't opposing us, and as I say, there were individuals. There might've been some actions taken by JACL supporting some of the, some things we're doing, but some of the things we're doing were just spur of the moment kinds of demonstrations against the Kingdome, the occupation of the HUD building in 1972 or 1973. There were actions that were taken right after a meeting, the next day we'd be in the streets, so there wasn't very much time for the organizations, like JACL or the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, to really react.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2417,"What's your sense, thinking back to those years, sort of in the '60s, was it because they wouldn't react, or did you have a sense that, even asked, would they have participated in the way you wanted?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2418,"I think because we were so far left that they didn't want to be perceived as supporting a leftist group, you know? Some people would brand us as Communist and I don't know where that came from, but hell, we didn't want to be involved in that political thing, even Democrats, Republicans, Communists, Sandinistas. Didn't matter to us. We had, our goal was to, was preserve the neighborhood for the people, the pioneers who built it. What we did was we looked at other neighborhoods similar to ours in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and we saw that neighborhoods were being lost. Manilatown in San Francisco, completely wiped out. Little Tokyo was being wiped, the residential population was being wiped out to make Little Tokyo more of a tourist attraction, and they were fighting for many years to try to keep it a residential base, but they lost it out. So, learning that, we said we will not, that will not happen in Seattle. Preserving either the buildings or building new buildings for the residents who built this community was the number one priority. Tomio, Shigeko, and those businesspeople agreed with that, to a point.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

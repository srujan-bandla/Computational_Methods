1070,"Well, she, she came over to this country when she was about fifteen, and she attended Maple Leaf grammar school for a couple of years, and so she picked up a little bit of English. During the time when they were in Japan, the parents had additional kids (in the U.S.), and she had a number of younger siblings. And it was kind of, they felt very uncomfortable with, like, my mother going to school, she was fifteen and she was in the first and second grade, and they were kind of ashamed to think that they had a dumb older sister. But there was, there wasn't the closeness between the ones that were born here and the ones that were in Japan because their culture was altogether different.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1071,"...of children. Tell me about those children, who were they?",Life after removal and during the incarceration

1073,"And so was that, did that, were there any problems or issues with that, or was that just kind of like, just felt normal to you? Or I mean, when, so you saw your, Connie, you probably didn't, did you call her, like, Aunt Connie?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1074,I never called her aunt. [Laughs],Life after removal and during the incarceration
1075,"She was just, like, more like a cousin, perhaps?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1076,Yeah.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1077,"Okay. And so, and so you talked about sort of this, maybe difficulties between the older siblings and the younger siblings? And a lot of it was the younger siblings, did you feel like they felt maybe a little ashamed because the older siblings didn't speak English as well? Is that what happened?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1078,"But my mother's younger siblings, Yutaka and Masao, they both went to high school and they were very fluent in English. They came over a little bit younger than my mother. But turned out that (...), other than Hiromu (who) had the greenhouse in the north end, they all lived in the south end of town, so we used to differentiate by the north enders and the south enders. So we weren't that close with the people in the north end.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1079,"So who, who were the north enders and who were the south enders? I mean, what was that distinction?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1080,"All the younger, younger ones lived in the north end.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1081,And so your family and Yutaka and Misao's family were south end?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1082,"South end, yes.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

1085,And so did he have the hotel before the war?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1086,"No, no, after.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1087,"Well, so in the '20s, what kind of work do you remember?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1088,"Well, after the, after the business was bankrupt...",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1089,"Oh, so you're talking, when you say ""war,"" were you talking about World War I?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1090,World War I.,Pre-war background to the incarceration
1091,"Okay, so he did that. And then how did that go?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1092,"Well, we were barely able to make a living, I guess. In 19'... I think it was about 1930, my dad decided to go back to Japan to visit his folks, 'cause he had never gone back. And so when he came back, then he opened up this little grocery store up on Capitol Hill.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1093,And where was the grocery store located?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1094,"On Belmont and Olive Way. It was an all-Caucasian neighborhood, and so I went to school, Lowell School up on Capitol Hill.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1095,So is that close to the B & O sort of restaurant?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1096,Yeah. The B & O restaurant took over the store that my dad had.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1097,"That's funny, I still go there and they have great desserts at night. Yeah, Belmont and Olive, is that why it's called the B & O? I just looked at that, B & O, Belmont and Olive?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1098,[Laughs] I don't know.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1099,"Apartment houses, and if you go further north, you have nicer homes that way. And so tell me about the customers of the store. What were they like, who were they?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1100,"Oh, most of 'em were working downtown. And in those days, not too many people had automobiles, so it was a short distance, about a mile downtown, so people used to walk downtown, and they lived in apartment. There were a few houses. Today, there's a lot more apartments up in that neighborhood, but those houses were torn down and new apartments went up.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1101,Lived in apartments. And how about your playmates growing up in this neighborhood? Who were they?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1102,"Oh, they were all Caucasians. There were several Swedish and Norwegian kids I used to play around with.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1103,And so what kind of games would you guys play in the neighborhood?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1104,"Oh, I didn't have that much time to play, 'cause I was working in, helping in the store all the time. And then I was involved in sports in school.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1105,"So you can't recall, like, at night or something, just playing around or doing games with some of your friends in the streets?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1106,"No, not at my... I had enough activities at school, so I didn't play around too much.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1107,So what school did you go to in that neighborhood?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1108,I went to Lowell. It was on Mercer and Federal Way.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1109,And how many other non-white or non-Caucasian students were at Lowell at this point?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1110,"We were the only Japanese there. I remember later on, there was one Chinese family that came there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1111,"By being the only Japanese, did you ever feel sort of singled out or discriminated against?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1112,"Oh, yes, at first I did. When I first went there, the kids used to pick on me because they, I was different. But my dad told me to keep a low profile, don't make any trouble. And so they kept on picking on me, and I didn't retaliate. Finally, I got to the point where I had to do something, so I said, ""Okay, I'm gonna put an end to this. Who wants to take me on?"" And the biggest guy, he decided he'd take me on. I, we were wrestling, and (recall) my dad had taken me to some of these judo practices, and so I just grabbed a hold of his collar and proceeded to choke him. And he was hollering, ""Unfair, unfair,"" and I said, ""What's unfairness got to do with it?"" and I kept, and I says, ""Give up? Give up?"" And he finally says, ""Yeah, okay, I give up,"" he was getting kind of blue in the face. [Laughs] And then, so I let him up and I says, ""Okay, who's next?"" [Laughs] Nobody wanted to take me on, 'cause I had beaten the biggest bully there. After that, I got along fine with all the other kids.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1113,"Oh, yes, at first I did. When I first went there, the kids used to pick on me because they, I was different. But my dad told me to keep a low profile, don't make any trouble. And so they kept on picking on me, and I didn't retaliate. Finally, I got to the point where I had to do something, so I said, ""Okay, I'm gonna put an end to this. Who wants to take me on?""

[Laughs] Nobody wanted to take me on, 'cause I had beaten the biggest bully there. After that, I got along fine with all the other kids.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1114,"Oh, that's a good story. So it took standing up to these bullies to actually get them to stop bothering you.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1115,Even after you explained to your parents why you had to do it?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1116,Yeah.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1117,They still thought that was wrong?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1118,"Yeah. But anyway, I got along fine, and I eventually got to be a leader in a number of activities. I was captain of the track team, captain of the soccer team, and captain of the School Boy Patrol, and president of the Boys Club. My academics were not that great when I first went there, but towards the end, I was an excellent student.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1119,"And I'm curious, some of the boys that were part of that group that bothered you, after that incident, later on, did some of them become your friends?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1120,"Oh, I don't recall the bully ever becoming my friends, but I had a lot of friends that were... you know, Lowell school was on the border of all the wealthy people up on Federal Way, and we were on the fringes. And so I had a lot of friends that were from wealthy family. Like the Schaefers, the Schaefers owned the Schaefer Building downtown, and their parents drove the kids to school with a chauffeur. And I believe a fellow named David Ernst, he was somewhat related to the Ernst Hardware. And there was a girl named Virginia Simpson that was part of the Simpson Lumber family. And so I went to school with a lot of the wealthy old-time families.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1121,"And so the families there would send their children to Lowell, and then you would interact with them. Did you get a sense of a class difference with these individuals? Did, was, in school, was there like a differentiation between the wealthy and the not so wealthy?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1122,"I sensed that there was a difference, 'cause we had two, two classes of the same class. They had us segregated, and it seems to me that all the kids in my class were from the lower side. There were a few that were in my class, but all the more elite kids were in the other half.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1123,"Did you get a sense that the, the other class got better, maybe, resources than your class?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1124,"Well, I think they were the same.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1125,"But yet, you felt like there was... did, do you ever recall your classmates in your class ever talking about the other class in a different way?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1126,"No, I... the only thing that, the reason I felt that way is that the majority of the kids in my class were down in the, lived in the south end of the district.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1127,"Yeah, because when I think about, yeah, if you go south, that's where, you're right, it's more what I would call the Broadway district, and there's more apartments. And if you go the other way, it's more the Volunteer Park, where you have more of the larger, larger homes. Anything else you can recall in terms of... 'cause that would be an interesting school to look at, because of the, especially during those years, the disparity in wealth because, 'cause those were hard times economically, when you look at the late '20s, early '30s, you're in the Depression. And so was there any influence in terms of the Depression on, that you could tell in terms of what was going on?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1128,"Oh, the kids in the north end, they lived in fine, fine homes, and I used to associate with all the, all those kids. I guess the reason was that I was, I was a fairly good athlete. I remember one instance, one of my friends had a birthday party, and the mother decided that she'd treat the kids to swimming at the Moore pool in Seattle. And all of us went down there with our swimming suits, and they declined to admit me to the pool. And the mother didn't say anything, the rest of 'em went in and had a good time, and I was left out. That was the first time I'd, I'd encountered discrimination in grammar school.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1129,Do you recall how you felt being left outside when the other boys went in?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1130,"Well, I kind of expected, it wasn't that bad because my father had, had experienced discrimination when we opened the store, and he told us to expect these things to come up.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1131,"But how about the mother who brought you there? You said, did you have any interaction, did she say anything to you when this happened?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1132,"I don't recall. There was about a dozen kids, so she was herding them around.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1133,"After the, the other boys were done swimming, did you do anything afterwards with the other boys? I mean, like, was there, like, a continuation of the party someplace, like dessert or something?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1134,"No, no, that was the end of the party. We had the party at their home, and then afterwards, they went swimming.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1135,Do you remember how old you were when this happened?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1136,"I must have been eleven or twelve, somewhere around there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1137,"You mentioned that at school, you got to know some of these more wealthy kids, or kids from more wealthy families. Were you ever invited to their homes?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1138,"Oh, yes, I was, I'd been in their homes. I especially remember a fellow named Jerry Swanson (whose) father owned a chain, chain of cigar stores down on the waterfront. They lived in a penthouse in one of their apartments, and I still remember, they had a large living room. The first time I'd been in a, a place where they had real thick, heavy carpeting, I could walk on it, and I thought, ""My goodness, what a luxury."" And they had a big grand piano there, and his older sister was taking singing, singing lessons. I couldn't imagine the amount of money that it took to live in a place like that. And they had, had an elevator to go up to their, their place. But I had a couple of friends that lived up on Federal Way, and they lived in huge, huge houses.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1139,"So Federal, like Federal Avenue?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1140,"Yeah, Federal Avenue.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1141,"What did you think when you went into these, these, sort of, really nice places like this?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1142,"Well, I felt that, gee, I saw all this elegant furniture and things like that, but contrasted, you know, the sparse homes that I lived in.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1143,"Conversely, some of these friends, did you ever have them, or invite them to your house? Did they ever come to your place?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1144,"No, never.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1145,And why was that? Was that something that you decided not to do?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1146,I was kind of ashamed to bring 'em to my place.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1147,"So you did sports in elementary, then after Lowell, where did you go?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1148,I went to the University of Washington.,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1149,"Oh, so Lowell went all the way through high school, or where did you go to high school?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1150,I went to Broadway High School.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1151,"And so would you say your friends in high school were still kind of like your Lowell school buddies more than Japanese, because you went north?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1152,"I associated mostly with the kids going north, 'cause they were my classmates from Lowell, and I really didn't... when we moved north, I was in the third grade, so I really didn't have any close friends.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1153,"And so if I were to ask you, in high school, who were some of your best buddies, which names would come to mind?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1154,"Oh, there's one, one person, Don Combs, he's, I still keep in contact with him. He lived in the north end, and I spent quite a bit of time with him. We used to go fishing together, I helped him when he painted his house one summer, we spent about a month painting the exterior of his house. Another person was Lyle Amundson. In Broadway, our roll room, the students were assigned alphabetically, and we sat on tables, and right next to me was Lyle, and I spent four years sitting next to him. And he eventually became a stockbroker and to this day, he was my stockbroker until he passed away a couple of years ago.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1155,"Oh, that's good. And so what kind of student were you, like, in high school? You mentioned earlier how you like athletics, and that eventually, you became a pretty good student. So how would you describe yourself at Broadway?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1156,I was an excellent student.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1157,And what kind of activities were you involved in at Broadway?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1158,I went primarily in track. I was the captain of the track team. I made the varsity in my freshman year in track.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1159,And what events did you do in track?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1160,Long jump and sprints.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1161,"So back then, when you were at that level, like the fastest in your age group in, or the longest jumper and one of the fastest runners, who would be your competition? Because you're, that's all over the city, right? So they're coming from all over. So would they be mostly Caucasians, or would they be other Japanese, or would they be, sort of, black?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1162,They were all Caucasian. There weren't too many blacks in Seattle at that time.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1163,"And the other, there weren't other Japanese or Chinese at this level?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
1164,Not that I'm aware of.,Life after removal and during the incarceration

But then his father sent him to Princeton. And to make ends meet, he took up boxing, and he was boxing in Madison Square Garden in the preliminaries, and he got hit too many times in the head.

He used to type all the editorials by himself, he'd sit on the typewriter and type things out. But that business was not very successful. He was always in debt. And he was a hand-to-mouth kind of operation. And I remember at the end of the athletic season, they used to have what they call a mixer up at Collins Playfield where all the athletes, the teams used to get, have a get-together after the season, and they have a dance there. And for the refreshments, they'd come and ask my dad to order all those things, like they used to have hot dogs and buns and potato chips and all the things like that. He didn't have any funds to pay for those, but my dad ordered the things, and I remember having to deliver all that stuff down to the Collins Playfield, and I think they used to charge admission of twenty-five cents. And long afterwards, they finally got enough funds to reimburse my dad. They got it from my dad's wholesale.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And then we used to give credit to the customers, whereas stores like A&P and Safeway never extended credit. So those customers stopped coming and they didn't pay their bills. So I still remember going with my parents to go out and try to collect some of those bills, 'cause we had bills that we had to pay to the wholesale house. And then shortly after, we started getting visits from the FBI, and they said some of our customers had complained to them that my dad was associated with, with some of the people that were sympathetic to the Japanese. We had a real good friend that was working for the Bon Marche, he was kind of a janitor, and he was a trusted employee of the Bon Marche. And at nighttime, after the store closed, he'd take the proceeds of the Bon Marche to the bank. Nobody would expect the janitor to be carrying the proceeds. He got picked up by the FBI and sent to Missoula, and we couldn't figure out why they would pick, pick him up. And the management at the Bon Marche vouched for him, but didn't do any good. And they finally found out that he was a bachelor, and he had an automobile, and so the, when the Japanese fleet came into Seattle on a visit, I think the Japanese community asked for volunteers to take care of some of the sailors. So he said okay, and he picked up three Japanese sailors and took them over on a tour and went up to Mount Rainier. And we figured that was the reason. The FBI was monitoring all the activities, and I think they checked on his license plate when he went down to the docks to pick up the sailors.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

1208,"I think so. My, I have no proof of that, but the FBI didn't name people, they said, ""One of your customers."" This happened two or three times, so we had several visits. The FBI would come out and says, ""Oh, another one of your customers called and so we have to check out everyone, every call.""

But I never knew how difficult it would be. You'd be bent over all day long, hacking the, hacking the top off. And then the truck would come by and you'd bend over, pick it up, throw it in the truck, and pretty soon the truck would be filled, and we were on, people on both sides of the truck throwing stuff up.

We were down in Tremonton, we were, the FSA camp was in Preston, Idaho, and we were trucked down a few miles. We had signed a contract to pick tomatoes for eight dollars a ton, and also we were supposed to be paid prevailing wages. So we were down there picking tomatoes, and we found out that the Cash Valley Farmers Association was short of help and they had, they were paying some of the local kids ten dollars a ton. And we got wind of that, and so says, ""Hey, we want the same pay that you guys are giving the local boys here."" And the farmer says, ""Oh, you guys signed a contract for eight dollars a ton."" And I says, ""Yeah, but we're supposed to be getting prevailing wages."" He says, ""That is the prevailing wage, eight dollars contract."" So they're playing games with us. They didn't realize that we weren't a bunch of idiots, uneducated Mexicans. Anyway, we said, ""Okay, you guys want to play games?"" I was a ringleader and in our group we had about eight in our crew. And one day we went out, farmers took us out to the field, we sat down and picked about two boxes of tomatoes, sat down and ate our lunch. The farmers came by and says, ""Hey, how come you guys aren't working?"" Says, ""We're working."" We says, ""We picked a few tomatoes."" And the farmers insisted, ""You guys signed the contract to pick for eight dollars a ton."" I says, ""Yeah, but the contract didn't say how many tomatoes we had to pick."" And that stalemate went on for, oh, about a week. And what they were doing was we were picking tomatoes that were green, and we're shipping them back to New York. And they were, tomatoes were mature, but they weren't turning color yet. But by the time it took the tomatoes to get to New York, they were starting to get ripe. And so here they're starting to get ripe in the field and the farmers were getting frantic. And we were just sitting there, and they finally says, ""Okay, we'll give you ten dollars a ton, but we're gonna hold back the two dollars until the end of the season."" I says, ""Okay, that sounds fair enough."" And so we went and picked tomatoes until the end of the season. One day we got a deep freeze, and everything turned black.

And I remember the first, the early, when we first got there, my uncle Tom, he was one of the first draftees in 1940, and he came, on his furlough, he came to camp because nobody's left in Seattle, so he came to see his mother. And they had a ruling that no military personnel was supposed to be inside the camp. You could understand why, some, some disgruntled Japanese would jump him, there could be quite a problem, and so they had the ruling that no military personnel would be in, permitted in the camp. So he came and the guards saw that he was, he was a sergeant in the army, and they wouldn't let him in. And it was, we visited for a couple hours, and then our, a friend of ours, a girl by the name of Yasuko Koyama used to be Stafford's secretary. She was the only Japanese civilian that was working inside the camp, she was a civil service employee, and she was Stafford's secretary. So Stafford said okay, he told Yasuko, ""Take my Cadillac and take the family outside. I can give permits for, for the residents to go outside."" So that's what we did, and we had a nice picnic lunch the following day when we got the permit. And we went out to Hazelton and visited with my uncle, the whole family went out, and we did that for a couple of days.

So anyway, since he accepted me, nobody else made any remarks or anything, and so I got along with most of 'em. That was in the early stages, and that's before they had that Vets Hall, and they used to hold chow mein dinners and, or I mean, bazaars at the Washington Hall. And in those days, these GIs were pretty much single, they used to have stag parties and all kinds of things. Since then, they've changed significantly.

1358,"Well, we figured that we had no money, so I figured, ""Why don't we set up a system where we have life membership?"" I had worked in the insurance business so I knew, I'm familiar with actuary, and so I figured, let's see, the vets are in their twenties, and we figured the life expectancy, and I figured, I calculated that at that time, the dues I think were either two or three dollars a year. I figured a hundred dollars would be a nice, came fairly close, would be fairly close, so I think that was a nice number, round number. So we set the price at a hundred dollars, and so we had enough people that became life members to pay for the materials.

1376,"No, not a great deal. There was a, part of the period of the Nisei Vets that was broken up was the fact that I was working on the construction of the Blaine, Blaine Church. I had to come up with some very creative financing for that period of time. I found out that, looking for help, there was no banks that would give us any loans. People were not interested, banks were not interested in loaning money to churches. I just got the results from that problem over in that church up on Tenth Avenue, Tenth Avenue and Aloha, it was that church that had started during the Depression, and the congregation couldn't meet their obligations on the mortgage, and the bank foreclosed on 'em. And it made the congregation so angry that they withdrew their money from the bank and they told their friends and relatives and they all made a run on the bank.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
1377,So what did you have to do for Blaine to make it work?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
1378,"Well, I had... we had a pledge program going on, it was three-year pledge, and money that wasn't coming in, and we had the obligation, the progress payments to make. And so I approached the congregation and told 'em, ""Hey, you people have money in the banks that are paying you four percent interest."" I says, ""How about loaning it to the church instead, and we'll pay you the same amount?"" Not only that, I got ten of the more influential members to guarantee the amounts in case they wanted the funds, and we sold bonds in five hundred dollar increments. And so a number of people purchased those bonds, and I raised fifty thousand dollars that way. The church program was, was about two hundred eighty thousand dollars I guess. We built that time when the World's Fair was being constructed, and all the subcontractors were working on the fair, and costs were skyrocketing 'cause of the shortage of labor, and so our costs were escalating. And then the Methodist Board of Missions agreed to lend us fifty thousand. And then I got a fifty thousand dollar loan from United Savings, and the reason we got that is George Kawachi, our member, was on the board when that bank first started up. They didn't have enough assets to loan us that fifty thousand, but they parceled it out among the rest of the banks. But we had the main loan with United. And their stipulation was that the members would open up an account with them to bring up their asset base, and so we talked to the congregation and so a number of people opened an account. And they serviced that loan to the, to the Mission, the Methodist Mission.",Legal challenges#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Military services

Todd Mayberry and Betty Jean Harry from the Oregon Nikkei Endowment are observing this interview, and Ian McCluskey from NWDocumentary is the cameraman. I am the interviewer Janet Kakishita, and I will be interviewing my uncle, Albert Oyama, for this project, sponsored by the Oregon Nikkei Endowment, part of the Minidoka oral history project.

465,And what was the name that you were given at birth?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
466,Albert Akira Oyama.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
467,And is there any significance to your name?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
468,"Not that I'm aware of. Akira, in Japanese, I understand, means ""bright light."" But other than that, I don't know anything about it.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
469,"Okay. And let's talk a little bit about your father, get to know your father. What was his full name?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
470,"His name was Iwao Oyama, and he's from Japan. He grew up in Yamanashi-ken, which is an area due west of Tokyo. He grew up as a farmer's son, though his grandfather, I understand, was a medical doctor in that area.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
471,And how about your dad? Was he going to school then?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
472,"Yes. He was the second-born in his family, and I believe he was the second. And he went to Waseda University in Tokyo. He graduated from Waseda, which, at that time, was known primarily as a journalism school. So he graduated there before he came over to the United States.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
473,Okay. And how did he decide to come to the United States?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
474,That I don't know. I never talked to him about that.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
475,Do you know how many brothers and sisters he had?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
476,I think he was the second in a family of five children.,Life after removal and during the incarceration

481,"And how did your mother decide to come, her family decide to come to the United States?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
482,"That I don't know, although she was one of the few that went to college, she graduated from Tokyo Women's College. And why she decided to come to the U.S., I don't know. I don't even know if she knew my father at the time when she came over or not.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
483,"Okay, let's talk about both of them now. How did they meet and get together?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
484,Again...,Life after removal and during the incarceration
485,Do you know?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
486,"I don't know. All I know is that they met, and I believe they both met in Seattle. And my mother's uncle was a newspaper man, and he ran the newspaper in Portland, Japanese newspaper in Portland, Oregon. So I think my father came down to Portland to learn the newspaper, because my uncle wanted to go on down to San Francisco, and do a Japanese newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. My mother evidently came to Portland about the same time, and they were married here in Portland in 1922. So that was probably a year or two after they came over from Japan.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
487,"Thinking of your father, how would you describe him and his personality?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
488,"Well, strictly a businessman. He ran the Japanese newspaper, as I said, it was a regular printer with Japanese type, and had about, I guess around twenty or twenty-five employees at the time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
489,What else do you remember about the newspaper? Did you get to go down and help at the shop?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
490,"I used to deliver papers. And I'd deliver to all the north end Japanese people, businesses, and I remember being paid eight dollars a month for that job.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
491,And did you do it by bike or bus?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
492,"I walked. In the north area, most of the businesses were close together in what's now known as Japantown, so I just walked that route. The south was a little farther spread out, but I did not deliver in the south, there was another route, that place.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
493,"What was the name of the newspaper that your dad started, and where was it located?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
494,"It was called the Oshu Shimpo, and Japanese type only, no English, and it was a daily, Monday through Friday.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
495,And where was this newspaper office located?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
496,"The office is at the site now where the Nikkei Endowment office is, at Second and Davis.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
497,"So if you could think back, walking into your dad's newspaper, what would a person see? I mean, what did the business look like with the twenty, thirty people working?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
498,"Well, the thing that impressed me the most was his desk. And the reason his desk impressed me, it was always covered with papers and everything. But around three edges of the table, there were cigarette burns on all three edges, because my dad was a very heavy smoker. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration
499,How did they do the print in Japanese?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
500,"It was all type, it was sent over from Japan. So there was no hand typing or anything like that, it was all individual characters that were on lead type, and the ladies used to pick out the type from a large collection on the board. They would put it onto the press and have a printer, a mechanical printer that printed the paper.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
501,"We'll get back to the newspaper as we go through our interview, different phases. What was your mom like? What was her personality?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
502,"Well, that's not too easy for me to say. I didn't have too much to share with her. I was, I think I had one sister, Minnie, and I think the two of us pretty much grew up by ourselves, because my dad was never at home, he was always on business downtown or talking at various groups and things. So we never saw too much of him as we were growing up. But my mother was always at home.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
503,"And what did you observe about the relationship between your mom and dad? How did they deal with difficult situations, or how did they show affection?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
504,"My dad never used to take me fishing or hunting or anything, but we did always go to the community picnics that were held. And both my father and mother were members of the Nichiren Buddhist Church, so my sister and I of course went with him to the church.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
505,I'm going to talk now about your childhood. You said you had a sister Minnie. Was she older than you or younger?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
506,"She was two years older than I was. At the time when we grew up, we lived out in Montavilla as I mentioned, so we did not know many of the downtown north end or south end Japantown people. So we were sort of isolated from the Japanese community. Most of my friends were hakujin friends. There were a few Japanese families that lived out in the Montavilla-Troutdale-Gresham area that we knew, but they were few and far between. Most of my friendships, as I say, were with the hakujins. Also, my dad took me downtown to the YMCA, and he got me to be a member of the YMCA, downtown YMCA group, and so I had a lot of friends, mostly all hakujin friends, at the downtown YMCA, the one on Sixth and Taylor.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
507,What kind of activities did you do as a young person when you were out in Montavilla?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
508,"We had a basketball team of all the kids my age. We didn't play much football or baseball, mostly basketball, 'cause that was probably the easiest sport to play without equipment. So I think that was the primary thing that kept us going. Also, in Montavilla, there was a park present, so we used to go to the park and play a little bit there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
509,And so your basketball team was mostly hakujins?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
510,Yes.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
511,And did you move from Montavilla?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
512,"Yes. When I became high school age, we moved to, close to Washington High School, 17th and Ankeny, which is right next, one street over from Burnside street on the east side. But it was within walking distance of Washington High School, so we went to school there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
513,Were there... what was the population like at Washington? Were there Japanese there?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
514,"There were a few. Again, only a few. Most of my friends there also were hakujins.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
515,And what kind of activities did you continue to pursue or start up there?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
516,"I played basketball, continued to play basketball there. I managed to play on the Washington junior basketball team, not the major, the regular team, but the junior team. And then I took up the sport of table tennis. And so I played a lot of table tennis and got to be pretty adequate as far as that's concerned.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
517,How did your family decide to move to Montavilla and then to the Washington High School area?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
518,"I don't know. Of course, my sister and I were both very young at the time, so I don't know why, other than the fact that my father probably figured that since we were growing up, that it would be better to go closer in to town and take some part in the Japanese community activities, which I did. I became a member of the Troop 123, which was the Boy Scouts, Japanese Boy Scout troop, and I participated in the Japanese community's basketball group. They had a regular league of basketball players, and played every Sunday at Peninsula Park.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
519,And so this is how your family helped to keep you involved with the Japanese community?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
520,Yes.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
521,"And did you do other things besides, did you go to Japanese school?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
522,"Oh, in Montavilla there was a Japanese school in Russellville, and we went to school there in the evening, three times a week, Monday-Wednesday-Friday. So I was exposed to the Japanese language and Japanese teaching. Dr. Nakata, the dentist, was one of our teachers in Montavilla.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
523,So what was the curriculum mostly focused on? To have the ability to do conversational Japanese or to read and write?,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
524,"Reading and writing. I remember one story, there was one fellow named Aki Makino, who lived out in Montavilla close to where we lived. And during the annual recital time, he was supposed to sing a song. And the song is ""Haru ga Kita,"" which means, ""Spring is Here."" And he started to sing that song, instead of saying, ""Haru ga kita,"" he said, ""Saru ga kita,"" and saru in Japanese is ""monkey."" [Laughs] And so when he got by the first line, the whole audience broke up. It was quite an interesting recital at that time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
525,"Did you have a part in the recital, too?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
526,"Yes, but I don't remember... I had nothing funny happen like that, so I don't remember much about my participation.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
527,Did you live in houses when you were growing up?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
528,"Yes, just regular houses.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
529,Uh-huh. What do you remember about them?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
530,"Oh, I used to do a lot of shoveling of coal and hauling wood, because all we had was potbellied stoves in the Montavilla area. And then, of course, we moved into, by Washington High School, we had a regular wood furnace. So I still had to handle wood, the heating went much easier.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
531,"Did you have any other responsibilities, too, when you were growing up, besides keeping the fires going?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
532,"No, not much. There wasn't much to do. I remember my father saying that... he had a car, of course, and he used to drive us around. And when I became fifteen, close to sixteen, he said, ""Well, pretty soon you're going to be driving, but you have to know a lot more about cars than putting in gas and water."" So I said, ""Like what?"" And silence. [Laughs] He didn't say anything else after that. I got to learn how to drive after I turned sixteen.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
533,"No, not much. There wasn't much to do. I remember my father saying that... he had a car, of course, and he used to drive us around. And when I became fifteen, close to sixteen, he said, ""Well, pretty soon you're going to be driving, but you have to know a lot more about cars than putting in gas and water."" So I said, ""Like what?"" And silence. [Laughs] He didn't say anything else after that. I got to learn how to drive after I turned sixteen.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
534,Did he teach you?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
535,Did he teach you?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
536,"No, he was already interned. I didn't turn sixteen until after the war started. I was fifteen in December of '41. So the war started before I turned sixteen.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
537,"Before you could learn from Dad, okay. Thinking of your family life, what was mealtime like? Did your dad come home for dinner?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
538,"Well, I think most of the time probably so, but I just can't remember, not clearly, whether he did or not.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
539,Were there any special meals you remember that your mom used to cook?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
540,"Oh, only at special occasions like New Year's and so forth, they would have very fine banquet type dinners. Other than that, not routine. Routinely we had rice every evening, of course.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
541,But any favorite dish that your mom made that you enjoyed eating?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
542,"Nothing special, no.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
543,Okay. Did your family do activities together for outings or for fun?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
544,"Well, these picnics, these undoukais, they called them. They were the Japanese community picnics, and that's about the main outing that we participated in. There was always, of course, church, Nichiren church gatherings that we went to as a family.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
545,"Okay, well, think about the picnic. What do you remember about the picnics that you attended?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
546,"Mostly it was a chance to get to see, meet and see other friends from the other areas. We used to have races, running races and three-legged races, things of that nature.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
547,And what kind of food did they have at the picnics?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
548,"Oh, bento food just like in the boxes that you brought over and showed us today.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
549,And how about Nichiren? What kind of activities do you remember at church taking place?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
550,"Well, the main activity that I remember is going to play tennis before church on Sundays. We used to go to Benson High School, which is on the east side, and they had tennis, outdoor tennis courts there. And that's where I met my wife when we were still young kids. And we used to play tennis there and then go to church and sit through Sunday school at church. I can't remember much about Sunday school because most of the teachings were in Japanese. And my understanding and speaking of Japanese was pretty limited, because I didn't learn that much out in Montavilla Japanese school.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
551,Did they have any special holidays that they celebrated?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
552,"Oh, yes, they did, regularly, but I don't know what they were, though.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
553,Did they try to include American holidays in your celebrations?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
554,"I don't know. I can't remember. Oh, in our family, you mean?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
555,"I don't know. I can't remember. Oh, in our family, you mean?",Life after removal and during the incarceration

557,"Okay. Your school. Probably Montavilla would be your grade school, right?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
558,(Vestal) Grade School.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
559,What do you remember about grade school days?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
560,"One incident that I could remember is being a little bit late in going to school, and when I got to school, all the kids were already inside the school building, and I couldn't open the school door because the doors were so heavy. And so I went home crying and then my mom brought me back to school, opened the door for me, and explained to the teacher why I was late that day. I still remember that incident because I just wasn't strong enough to open that school door. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration
561,And what do you remember about your classroom or your classmates? Were they mostly hakujin?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
562,"Yeah, almost all hakujin. I can only remember one Asian girl that was in the same class as I was, and her name was Grace Wong. She was a Chinese girl whose family lived in the Montavilla area. But I had no other Japanese or Chinese classmates in my class.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
563,"How did the kids, the other kids in the classroom treat you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
564,"Oh, I never felt any separate treatment or prejudice or anything. I think I felt pretty much like I belonged there, and nobody made fun of me or did anything to make me feel like I was not fully acceptable by the school and the kids.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
565,Were they interested in your culture and heritage? Did they want to learn more about what Japanese was?,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
566,"No, not that much interest.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
567,So you had no opportunity to share. Would they come home to your house and do things with you?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
568,"Oh, yeah. I'd go to their place and they'd come over to my place, and we'd play and so forth. But there wasn't much discussion or talking about being Japanese or anything different.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
569,"Okay, how about when you moved to Ankeny area and went to Washington High School? Do you have any interesting memories of your high school days?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
570,"Well, I remember playing basketball on the junior team, which was the secondary team, not the main team. And I remember, after the war broke out, I remember our team traveling to different schools, and I remember it was either Jefferson or Roosevelt, and the only prejudiced thing that was said was when I was going to shoot a foul shot, somebody in the audience said, ""Remember Pearl Harbor."" I still remember that voice saying that. But other than that, there wasn't any prejudice against me. I was also very interested in table tennis as I mentioned, and I became pretty proficient in that. I joined the Portland table tennis club which had a facility right across the street from the downtown public library. So I used to go there quite often to play table tennis. I entered many of the tournaments that we had there for boys that were sixteen and under. After the war broke out in December of '41, all of the Japanese ancestry people were supposed to be in their homes by eight o'clock, and not be outside away from home after eight p.m. every night. Well, I wanted to enter the tournaments that they had, table tennis tournaments downtown in the club, and so I had to, quote, ""break the rules"" and stay there past eight o'clock. But because I did that, I was able to win the Oregon State sixteen and under boys table tennis tournament. The Northwest tournament was held in February of that year, of 1942, and so I became the northwest boys sixteen and under champion. And then I played at the Pacific Coast championship, which was also held in Portland that year, in '42, and I won that. So I became the Pacific Coast sixteen and under boys table tennis champion, and I had some kind of national seeding of twenty or twenty-one or something like that.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
571,Were your parents worried or did they know that you were doing this?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
572,"No. Well, my dad was already interned by that time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
573,And so your mom?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
574,Yeah. Nobody ever said anything.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
575,"How about your tennis team, your table tennis team? Were they concerned or did they help you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
576,"No, they didn't say anything. There were several Chinese players at the tennis club, and they were more sympathetic to me than anything else.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
577,"What are your memories of Japanese community events when you were growing up? You talked a little bit about the picnic, but are there other community events that your family or you participated in?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
578,"I joined the Japanese community's Boy Scout troop, Troop 123, which met at a Methodist church downtown. We formed the drum and bugle corps, so we used to get together and play at various festivities, and we played in the Rose Parade here in Portland. We were invited up to play in the Seafair Parade that they had up there every summer. I didn't make it up there because I had the mumps at the time, so I didn't get to make that trip. But I played the bell lyre because I had taken piano lessons, and so I knew all about the musical notes, and so I played the bell lyre in the drum and bugle corps.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
579,"Did your parents have expectations about keeping Japanese culture alive in you and Minnie, or did they talk about how you have to be Japanese and how you have to American?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
580,"I don't think that was stressed very much. My parents took my sister and me to Japan when we were, I think I was four, five, six years old or something, and we stayed there for maybe less than a year. But other than that, they did not emphasize anything about Japan or Japanese culture. I think they pretty much assumed that we were going to be assimilated into the regular U.S. American culture.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
581,"When you went to Japan, do you have any memories of that? You were like six years old, you said. Can you remember anything? Did it impress you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
582,"I can't remember anything except one thing, and that was that they had all these shoji screens in Japan, and I can remember pointing my finger and poking my hole through the shoji screens and getting bawled out by my parents and their brothers and sisters. That's all I can remember about Japan. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
583,"So they spent a while there with family, and you were able to meet family, but you were very little then?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
584,Yes.,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
585,How did you travel? Was it by ship?,Life after removal and during the incarceration#Redress movement#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

589,"Your father's business, we talked about that, and we talked about that you did have some responsibility delivering the paper. Is there, did your father own this himself?",Military services#Pre-war background to the incarceration
590,"Yes. I think that the paper was started by a relative of my mother's, a Mr. Abe, he would have been my mother's uncle. He came to Portland long before my father and mother came here, and started the Japanese paper here. And then he wanted to move down to San Francisco to either start or handle the paper in the Bay Area, so I think at that time he invited my dad to take over because of his journalism background, to take over the newspaper here in Portland.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Pre-war background to the incarceration

602,"Well, we came home immediately after that. And when I came home, the FBI agents were, there were, I think, three of them, were still in our house, and they were searching our house for my father. And my mother told him that he was down at the office downtown, but they wanted to search the house anyway. So they were going through every nook and cranny and door of the house looking for him.

606,"Yes, he was put in Multnomah County jail, and I don't know how many Japanese community leaders were there, but there were a number of them there.

And so we took a boat, went out to that unit, and made a thorough search of the apartment there, but we couldn't find any trace of her. Her body floated after... I think it was about three or four weeks after the flood was over, that the body was, floated and they found it.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
699,So they were able to find it?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
700,Yeah.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
701,And then you went to medical school. How did the path go there?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
702,"At the medical school, I became a member of the class of 1953, and there were two other Japanese American students in the class. So there were three of us Japanese Americans in the class of '53, and there was one Chinese fellow that was also in the class. I was able to maintain my grades there, and so I kept the scholarship for all four years. They have a medical school honoring group called Alpha Omega Alpha, which I became a member of. And so my life at the medical school was pretty easy. The only thing I didn't have is much money, so after I told Mas -- she wasn't my wife then -- she was at the University of Oregon, I told her that I had enough money to go to two years of medical school, but I didn't know how I was going to finance my last two years. ""So if you can work and save money for two years, then we could get married at the end of the second year of medical school and then you can support me my last two years."" She said, ""Okay."" So she worked hard the first two years while I was in medical school. We got married between my second and third year in medical school, so I was able to finish with her support. And now I have to support her through the rest of her life because of those two years. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
703,"And is there anything you did differently with them than you did with your, than your dad did with you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
704,"No, I think all three boys, we tried to stress the importance of education to all of them. The first and the oldest one was not interested. He was more interested in cars and things, so he spent one year at the University of Oregon, but didn't stay. He didn't graduate. The second son also went to University of Oregon. It's funny how everybody in our family went to University of Oregon. He went there and graduated in the business school there. The third son also went to University of Oregon, he decided he liked science, so he decided to become a physician also. And so he took pre-med down there, and he got accepted to the University of Oregon medical school when he finished school in Eugene. Now he finished medical school, he finished his training in pathology at the medical school, and he's now a pathologist at Good Samaritan Hospital here.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
705,"So you've been doing community service and supporting the cultural kinds of things, and things that promote better understanding of Japanese, the Japanese American community and the medical field. You had, in our pre-interview, you had a really good story about the support of a hakujin friend that grew up with you, and when you were at the assembly center, he did something special for you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
706,"I had two people come visit me at the assembly center here in Portland when I was interned there. One was a teacher, she was my English teacher, Ms. Plympton, who was very sympathetic to the whole situation. And the other was a classmate named Don Peterson. Don Peterson and I used to play basketball together, we played table tennis together, we were very close friends. When I ended up going to the assembly center, Don got my yearbook -- this was in May when we went to the assembly center. So Don got my yearbook in June, and he passed that around to our classmates. And he got a lot of signatures and comment in the yearbook for me at the same time that he got signatures for himself, and he brought that to me, to the assembly center and gave it to me. Don Peterson became quite famous, he was probably the most famous person in our class from Washington High School, because after years of working hard, he became president of the Ford Motor Company. And so a number of years later, I wrote him a letter to congratulate him, and he wrote back and said, ""Thank you very much,"" and that he certainly remembered me very well from the school days.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
707,Is there any lesson or experience that you want to pass on to your grandchildren or your great grandchildren about the war experience that you went through?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
708,"Well, only in that they've given talks, the grandchildren have given talks at their high schools, and the message I think is, ""Please don't let this kind of thing happen again."" So that's the main message. As far as they're concerned, we want them to continue their education and being as good as they can as far as the education in general, life in general.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

710,I don't think so.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
711,Everything covered?,Life after removal and during the incarceration

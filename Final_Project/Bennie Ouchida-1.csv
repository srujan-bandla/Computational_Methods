They have sumo, and then we used to go to the deep bath which felt real good, but that's about all, Japantown. People down there, they talk too fast for us slowpoke farmers. Besides, they talked a different language. I think they talk Tokyo language, more national language, us, a Kyushu language.

So I got caught on that and a lot of things. Folks don't understand what we have to have in the school course. But it was, biology and stuff was very interesting. I liked it just like algebra or geometry. But history or literature, I don't know. I don't know who could understand literature and half of it Latin, so I flunked that. I'm not ashamed of it.

Even though I have to hitchhike and beat the bus, I used to do that and get home, then load up and head to the Pacific Fruit and dump it there and see how much, what we can get out of that.

It's survival, big family, but we did it. If we didn't do it, we'd be the laughing stock on the, among the Japanese race, because they always look at each other, and they start laughing. Although my dad always -- certain family was suffering this and that, he would go down and try to help them out, but I didn't see anybody come and help us out.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

But naturally, the literature, I can't understand that because I can't do that lingo they use. But the rest of it, geometry or any of those science, boy, I'm right at the top. But some of those subjects, I can't have because I didn't pass this one or that one. They won't let me have it. It kind of makes me sorry, but I did my best. And they all come in handy when you go, after you finish high school, you know. You could use them. So I always said like history, it's nice to know, but gee, who wants to know about the people that already passed away? It's better to learn something they did if they're living, you know. That's what I hate about history. And I always ask, wondered how come like the Civil War, why don't they come out with a map? It's a certain day, you know. This general did this or this general did that, and then draw the picture how they progressed and who won the war. They don't have that. You had to just read it. Well, that's pretty hard, just read and figure out where they're at. Where's Saratoga at? Chattanooga. Is it in Georgia or, there's two Chattanooga, things like that. That's what used to get me in history. History [inaudible]. So I have a tape. It says north and south. The thing says north and south, the battlefield, kind of late but I got a tape.

Then all of a sudden my mom says, ""This year, you're going to go to school,"" just like that. So I looked at her, said, ""You learn mechanics,"" so she sent me to Oregon Tech over there on Fourteenth and Taylor. So I take a bus and streetcar go down, down Fourteenth and Taylor and then go back. Three years I did that.

I got to, I haven't got a chance to go anyplace else, help, but I did go. They tell me so and so is coming in. I said, okay. Then I would walk mile something, mile and a half to a service center and find them and talk to them, you know.

The other guy will tell him, so it went pretty good. We got off at Fort Leavenworth. [Laughs] Not the penitentiary now, the Fort. When we get off, Sergeant says, ""Now listen. See that thing over there standing, that's the penitentiary, federal penitentiary over there. In the back is a guardhouse, so think before you do anything.""

Big trucks, the cab, the driver sits almost in front of the front wheel, and you hang way out there. It's a pontoon moving along, a long pontoon, and the cab is pushed forward because the pontoon is long, so unload those and others. And what this white guy did is that when the boys went under the truck to cut the straps off, strap tie down, take them all off, you get some clear so that he could start it and move it out. Well, one of them have to spring back up. Reason, he started the motor up and just smoked the inside of the boxcar. It's inside boxcar, smokes it out, so the boys there crawl out of there. And then the guy, he come out and says, ""You guys sabotage. You left the strap on to break the line so would be no break."" Oh, big, made big noise. So I told Major, I says, ""You know, it's either get rid of that guy or I'll take the crew."" I'll go up there and unload the thing because I did unloading in Fort Lewis. So Major says well, he says, ""Where these boys at?"" I said, ""I dispatched them to all the other jobs. They're not here."" The guys are standing right there. He didn't listen to me, telling big lies, you know. Oh, this is straight stuff. Then I told them, well, I'll run the boys and we'll get up there and finish the job. Oh, okay, sergeant said, and Major left. So I rounded up the boys and went up there and unloaded the rest of the vehicle and then that was that. Later on, reason is that when he shipped these vehicles, they sent certain ones to Fort Riley or certain ones to Fort Crew. Fort Crew, they had a lot of jeeps and weapons, pickups up there. It has to be brought to the exchange. It's just heavy stuff have to go up there. So I ask the boys, I said if they know how to drive the big stuff. Sure, Imoto, the little guy, he said, there's no safety belt on these. So you sit sideways because you can't reach the gas pedal or brake and the big steering wheel, and there's three transmissions see, and I use a lot of the split. And this is how you drove that thing, big stuff. But we took that up there. It worked out fine because it don't go any faster than 35 miles an hour anyway, so you don't have the accordion.

They go to Frisco. Oh, these are Oriental. They round them up and stuck them up in stockade. Oh, the fire really went up. And when it did go up, didn't you see those orders that they're all carrying and the master orders. They got to get on that ship. You held them back one day. It might turn the war over, you know.

So he might be the one that there's one case where they march in with the enemy and listen to everything, then he come marching right back out again. They were saying, ""Which section have you come from?"" I come from so and so section and got lost, so then I'm coming over here, you know. I'll blend in that way. But I tell you, some of these guys, or they'll sneak in from the back and listen in to the office or tap into radio telephone line, all kinds. The other one is there is one island that nobody could understand that language. See, everyone has a different language, so that particular island is the language that they used. So they asked by listening to the radio, what is it? Oh, that's that particular island that their folks come from. So they took him to the Washington, D.C. and listened to all the rest of the lingoes and then try to find out what they're saying. Anyway, I lost part of it.

This is the first time they ever started Japanese school, and they were going to move it to Maryland, and they did not. And then out of this in a very quick order, they have to hurry up and get some kids to listen and write it out so that they could follow-up and be on guard over there. They had pictures of a grandma's place over there. Then they say to look down. He says, ""Yeah, that's a chicken house."" That's how close they had pictures of just like we had in California. Take us out of range and merchant ship comes in coming down, they take a sound radar of the beach or the coast and they pay them for it. They do the same thing. You get paid for this plain pictures you got. And that's how -- and people don't know this. It's a big business selling pictures of each other. You know that? This is old stuff. I'm sorry. What else is there? There was one that they were actually going to invade Japan. This is a good one. They told the whole class about it. Nobody see it, nobody knows about it. It's a fish trap, long one. It's a dike at the lowest tide, it's underwater. It's green. You can't see it. So when you try to land in that, you get stuck on that rock pile. And fish that's inside, they can't get out, so they scoop the fish out. So they could really shoot and sink everybody right there. They told them about that. That's what's out there.

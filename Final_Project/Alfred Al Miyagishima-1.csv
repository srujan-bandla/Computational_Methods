On camera we have Kirk Peterson with the National Park Service, and we're doing this interview for the National Park Service, it's the Manzanar National Historic Site in partnership with Densho: the Japanese American Legacy Project. So this is a partnership. And so today we have Albert Miyagishima as our person. So Albert -- or Alfred, I'm going to start at the very beginning, I'm sorry. So can you tell me your full name when you were born?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

715,And do you know why you were named Alfred?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
716,"Yeah. Nobody ever told me, but we used to have a summer visitor who was a professor at the University of Georgia, and they used to come to Scottsbluff every summer, and him and his brother George and his, Alfred's wife, I believe one of 'em was a professor, his brother was a dentist. And one of 'em, I can't remember which, used to teach Japanese school in the summer. And I really don't know what the relationship was with other people there or whatever, but I think I was probably named for him.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
717,"Okay, that's good. And then the Shunji, where did that come from?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
718,"My brother's name is Shunichi, and I guess ""Shun"" is more of the given name, ""ichi"" is the first son, ""jun,"" ""ji"" is the second son, so my brother's name is the ""first son,"" ""ichi,"" Shunichi, and I'm Shunji.",
719,So let's talk about your father first. What was his name and where in Japan was he born?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
720,"Well, for some reason, he started out, his name was Gontaro Miyagishima, and he was born in Shizuoka, Japan, and I don't know what town it was. I believe the year was 1890, and later on he changed his name to Toshiro, and I remember he used to sign our, my report cards ""Fred G. Miyagishima"" for the longest time, then all of a sudden it changed to ""Fred T."" So I really don't know what transpired at that time to change the name. Gontaro is a very ancient name, you know. My mother --",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
721,"Before you get to your mother, your father's family, what did they do in Japan? What did your father's family do in Japan?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
722,"I have no idea. My father passed away when he was fifty-six or fifty-seven. I spent two years in the service probably at the time that I should be asking a lot of questions. But we were put in the camp, you know, the evacuation camps at that time, and then I spent I spent two years in the service. And then in the meantime, he passed away, so there's a void there that, well, the circumstances as it were created those things, and I wasn't ever able to ask him some of those questions. Because when you're younger, you don't, you're not inquisitive about those things, you're not mature enough to ask about 'em. When you get older, then you understand, you'd like to know.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
723,Did you ever get a chance to find out why he left Japan and came to the United States?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
724,"No. I think he was, he was in San Francisco, 1906, and it had to be before April because I think he told me that he was there during the earthquake, and he remembers the buildings coming down and shaking and fires and all that. He survived that, he didn't, he never told me what he did at that time or anything like that, but I think he was only fourteen years old or thirteen years old when he came across. No, he had to be older than that, sixteen, maybe. And it was soon after, I guess, he went to work on the railroad.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
725,"And so when he was sixteen in San Francisco, do you know what he was doing? Did he come, did he come with his parents or did he come by himself?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

728,No.,Life after removal and during the incarceration

Do you recall any stories that he said in terms of how people accepted him in the classroom, or was he kind of shunned, or were people fond of him? Do you know anything?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
730,"No, the only thing that I remember is he said he had relatives that was working along with the railroad, and some ended up in Salt Lake. I remember him saying that he had some relatives that was in Billings, Montana. I think he said he had a relative that owned a hotel there. I remember a lady and her two kids came to Scottsbluff to visit, and they were from Billings, and that my dad had registered for the draft during the war. Of course he said, by the time they started considering him, why, the war was over.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
731,So this was World War I?,Pre-war background to the incarceration
732,Yes.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
733,"So eventually he got to Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Do you know about what age he was when he got to Scottsbluff?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
734,"I sure don't. We have a picture of him when he worked for the Western Nebraska Republican, there was a gentleman named Bill Westervelt owned, owned the newspaper, and we had pictures of my dad sitting there at the desk. I have no idea what he did there as far as working for the newspaper. All I know is he was sitting there at the desk with a telephone and all that. So I don't know what his capacity was, but he spoke and wrote English at that time, and at the same time, he sold State Farm insurance for a while. And I do know that he used to broker -- what I mean broker is that that's the in-between for some of the Japanese farmers soliciting contracts with the beet companies, the Great Western Sugar Beet Company, and assigning contracts, going to the bank and securing loans because you always had to put the money out to get the seeds and all that, as part of the contract with Great Western.

I don't remember whether he had a jacket on or not, but I know Fred -- I mean, of course my dad was Fred -- but I remember Mr. Westervelt coming around the house every once in a while and Bill would have a little, little booze in him and I guess he'd start reminiscing about some of the old things, and he would come around and talk with my dad. But we were just little kids then so we didn't understand what they were talking about.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
737,But they were talking English back and forth?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
738,"Yeah, oh yeah.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
739,So let's talk about your mother now. So what was her name and where was she born?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
740,"Her name was Kiku Endo, and she came across from Japan with her father and mother, which would be my grandparents, and they settled in Hillrose, Colorado. And I believe my aunt Louise, that's where she was born, and she was the only daughter, and in time, they moved to the Scottsbluff area. I think my dad and my mother married in Denver. It seems like I've seen a picture of, they had a wedding and then it appears that... Hillrose is just a one-horse town, you know, it was a little farm town, and it didn't seem like that was appropriate for a wedding. It looked like the way she was dressed and everything, I think it happened here in Denver. My dad had lots of friends here in Denver, and whenever we used to visit Denver, we used to go visit some of his friends and stuff. And I have no idea whether they were ken people, you know, from Shizuoka or something like that.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
741,"So I'm curious, what was the connection between Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and Denver? Why, what was your father connected so much to Denver?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
742,"Well, my father opened up a store that had a lot of Japanese goods in Scottsbluff, and he called it the Mount Fuji Company. And of course, lot of his goods and stuff came from here in Denver, and that's where he would do most of his ordering for things. And, of course, fish came from either in the San Pedro area, or it came from Seattle Fish, and they would ship it. I remember Dad used to go to the railroad station, and then tell everybody to get their orders in for some sashimi and things of that nature, mackerel. So then my mom would cut it into serving size, I guess, and she would, I guess you'd call it butchering the fish, and then my dad would deliver it. They had, Mabel, all of my siblings were all born in Scottsbluff, so after they were married, then they came to Scottsbluff. So evidently, I'm thinking that my father probably had established himself in Scottsbluff before they got married.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
743,"Going back to your mother's family, what type of work did they do?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
744,"Oh, they were, they farmed. They were... I think most of the Japanese didn't have any kind of skills, and of course farming was relatively, just back-breaking work and the will to work. So there was, a lot of Japanese all went to farming for other people with a share and this and that, and eventually they saved up enough money to buy their own farms. Of course, I think, at that time, I don't believe that there was, the law said that you couldn't own, that aliens couldn't own land. And I don't know whether that was a federal law or what it was.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
745,"So I'm curious about this one, because both your, well, your mother was already in the United States, most of the people I've interviewed, their parents were married through kind of an arranged marriage between, with the woman being in Japan and the man being in the United States. In the case of your parents, how did the two of them meet?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
746,"That, that is... I just never did find that out. But I imagine it was one of those, the Japanese term is baishakunin.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
747,"At that particular time, when you're, Nebraska, if you go out in a place out in Nebraska, ""Where is that?"" Even today, people don't know where Nebraska's at, you know, as small as this world has gotten to be. But everything, hardly anybody traveled out of the community, and maybe they came to Denver and back and that's about it. They never went to Lincoln, Lincoln was probably another two-hour drive from Scottsbluff, whereas coming here to Denver was, what, four hours, five hours at that time, slow traffic, and the train ran there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
748,"So when you talk to some of the old-timers that perhaps knew your father, how would they describe him? What kind of man was he? Do you have a sense of, in terms of his personality, or was he talkative, was he quiet? What do you know about him?",Life after removal and during the incarceration

750,"You know, he spent more time at work than he spent as being a father. He was always someplace delivering, get up early in the morning, we never even seen him get up to go to work. And then, of course, we're all in bed by the time he'd come back, lots of times. And he'd do his book work during the day and all that stuff, get stuff ready and put the orders together, and he'd go out and deliver. And in those days, you know, one-way trip over ten or fifteen miles, from one town to the next town, and as it were, the Japanese, well, where they settled was probably within a ten-mile area in most cases, but I do know that he went to some places which was probably thirty, forty miles away on a, on a trip. So I don't know whether he stayed overnight in some of those places, which I suppose people did in those days because travel was kind of slow. He had a pickup truck and he loaded up and off he'd go.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
751,"And so you never heard stories from people like, ""Oh, your dad was like this,"" or they remembered your dad and they just mentioned something to you? Or do you even recall when we was with Mr. Westervelt in terms of how he was just with some of his business people?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
752,"Well, he was able to hold a conversation, most of, a lot of my conversations, I guess, with my father would be during the times I was in the service and we communicated by mail quite often. But he always used to tell me to, he always instilled in me, ""Alfred, be a good soldier and do as you're told to do. Obey your superiors, don't bring shame to our family,"" things of that nature. I think that's kind of his evaluation that they bring from Japan to this country. And you know, they just kind of instilled that all the time, and I remember that's what he used to talk about a lot of time.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
753,Let's talk about your mother. What was she like?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
754,"She was an awful hard worker, she raised the kids and feed 'em and she used to work the store when my father got ill. And here she had to run the store by herself, and I remember her making tofu and making age, and most of the stuff that she had to prepare she did herself. My dad probably showed her how or he went someplace and learned and then showed her. And then, of course, he did the outside part of the business and she did the inside part of the business. And I remember not so much my dad being in the store except when he was behind the desk working his abacus. But I remember being with my mom and maybe I wouldn't feel good and we had a little cot there. It wasn't really a cot, it was more like a table, tabletop with the side put up that she would put me in when I was a little kid and wasn't feeling well. That's the only thing that you remember -- other times I'm out playing someplace. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration

But she, I think she graduated high school in '36 or '37 I think. Maybe '38, I can't remember. So '38, so then she took a job, I think she waited tables for just a little while, 'cause they always, there was a Japanese restaurant in town. It wasn't a Japanese restaurant, but it was owned by Japanese, they served mostly American fare, called the Eagle Cafe. And it was one of the better restaurants there right in downtown, and every once in a while they used to call and say they needed another, you know, somebody didn't show up, ""Could Mabel come and help us for a while?"" She used to like the tips, 'cause I remember, I remember when I was a little boy that on windy days in the wintertime, the wind would blow the door open and they couldn't keep it shut because of the fierce wind that would blow up here in the wintertime. So they used to call me and said, ""Alfred, would you come and close the doors for us?""

760,"Mostly just the Japanese farmers from that area. I don't know the exact number of the Japanese farmers. I think there was some of kind of publication came out said there was fifty farmer families or whatever, I don't remember. But there was quite a few farmers all in that North Platte River Valley there, and they went mostly along the river, 'cause, of course, that's the most fertile land there is. I couldn't tell you how many, but there used to, my dad used to have the rice come in, and then he used to call the farmers and the farmers used to bring their trucks right up to the train station and load, load right from the boxcar right into their trucks.

763,"How about, did your parents, do you know if they had to ever extend credit to the farmers? I think of farmers, and their income is sort of seasonal. And so when they buy the seeds and things like that, sometimes they would have to borrow or get things on credit and then pay after the harvest, things like that. Do you recall those kind of cycles that your parents had to do with the farmers?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
764,"No, I really don't, but probably from experience I could tell you it's just an ongoing, ongoing thing. If the crops turned out good, like if they raised sugar beets for the sugar beet company, they would get paid on how much tonnage per acre, and they would all kind of get the most tonnage per acre. And I remember the farmers used to talk about, ""So-and-so got 20 tons per acre,"" and everybody said, ""Wow, that's pretty good,"" and then somebody would say, ""Well, so-and-so up on the so-and-so place only got 14,"" and then they'd talk about sugar content of the sugar beets. And that also helped as far as how much money you would receive for your sugar beets, too, they would grade your sugar beets, how much sugar was in there and stuff like that.

And there also was a gambling group -- actually it was only two, two men that... that would be an interesting history, because I remember in the back room they used to have a place called the club. And the place where my dad's grocery store was, they had some apartments downstairs, they had some rooms upstairs, they had an area in the back that had a couple bedrooms and a big area which they called the club. And the, lot of the single men used to hang out there and play hana, or they would play go, and on given nights, why, they would play hana for money. And I know Nishi-san and Watanabe-san used to be the ones that had the games. They also had roulette tables in the back, and they never brought those out, but I do know that one time I was back there peeking around and I saw some roulette tables. So somebody told me that years and years ago, they used to go to these railroad camps with their equipment, chuck-a-luck, I guess, roulette, some other games, and they would travel from camp to camp and set up a gambling thing, and that's how they made their money.

And the Buddhists, all the, lot of these, I guess a lot of these people from Japan were, were all Buddhist at one time. But when they came to this country, why, the influence was Christianity. And most, as far as I remember, it was Episcopalian, and I myself was baptized as an Episcopalian. And I think as some of the older ones grew up, and after the war, there wasn't, I think the Christianity kind of lost its hold because of the war. And as I remember, lot of the older, older people reverted back to Buddhism even though they didn't know anything about Buddhism, but their families were. So the reverend here at the Tri-State Buddhist Temple, they expanded their territory to include Western Nebraska, and I guess they go to Wyoming. I imagine they, they include parts of New Mexico, too.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
799,"So I'm not quite sure I understood that. So you said during the war, people kind of left Christianity to be more Buddhist, is that what you just said? I wasn't quite sure. When you said the Buddhists were able to expand, that was because people kind of, during the war, left Christianity?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
800,"No. I think the people that were pretty much in charge of the Christianity in Western Nebraska, Reverend Kano, he was interned, I think, or somehow he was taken, interrogated because he had, he was an influence with the Japanese people. And I think at that time, the hold, toehold came apart because there was no one there to take his place.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
801,"Growing up in Nebraska, I'm wondering, did you, how did you think about being Japanese? Did you think about, or say to yourself, ""I'm Japanese, I'm different,"" than your white friends? Did your parents ever talk to you that by being Nihonjin or Japanese, that you were different than people? Do you remember anything like that?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
802,"Yeah, you know, there was... it never occurred to me except when I was around white adults, and they would make a comment, ""the little Jap boy"" or something like that, and I wasn't allowed to do something because, ""we don't want that little Jap boy hanging around,"" and stuff like that. And I remember as a little kid, crying, said, ""Why was I born Japanese?"" And I didn't understand because you're young, you're immature, and you really don't have anybody to ask. But my sisters used to tell me, says, ""You shouldn't pay any attention to that."" Says, ""You was put on this earth as Japanese and so you should be proud that's what you are."" But you know, when you go play with your friends and this and that, and their parents are, whatever, calls you down like that, it really hurts your feelings. ""Why was I born Japanese when there's all these hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of other people laying around?"" But you don't understand the other part, where, see, there was very, very few blacks in our town. Most of 'em were dropped off because of the railroad or something. And I can't remember, maybe two families in the whole town. Mexican people are really looked down upon because they were the hired people from all the farms and this and that, and they were, at that time, they were really unreliable. When you get older, you understand why they're unreliable, because they had no future.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
803,"Okay. So eventually, when you were around thirteen years old, thirteen, fourteen, your family moved from Scottsbluff, Nebraska, to California. Can you explain why your family moved to California?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
804,"Yeah. My father, during one of his deliveries to, to the farmers, was caught in a blizzard. Stalled his car and all that, and he got quite sick from that, he caught pneumonia. Got stuck in the snow and whatever, and he caught pneumonia. Well, they treated the pneumonia, but even at that time, there was not a lot of medicine to help cure that. Eventually it turned into tuberculosis, and then he was unable to work. So my mom took over and doing the best she could, but as far as doing the ordering and trying to keep it up, she just couldn't do it. So push comes to shove, why, I guess my father's sister in California said to bring the family out. They lived in Teminus, California, which is twenty or thirty miles outside of Stockton, and they were farmers there. So we went over there, took a train ride, stopped at Salt Lake City, met some more friends and went on to California. My dad was still bedridden, my mother did the cooking for the farmworkers, and it was really something new for her to do. She just got shoved into it, and I know she had a really tough time. They had maybe ten workers there that she had to prepare breakfast and lunch and supper for, and I think she must have really had a tough time. Because it's just something that you just don't get into and cook for all those people and keep 'em happy and try to make a menu. And I know she had a tough time. Eventually we moved back into Stockton, and my dad still was unable to work. My sister was working someplace, my brother and myself and the rest of the kids were still in high school. We used to, I remember one year we went out to try to work on the farm doing planning and stuff like that, but it just didn't work out for us. But then the war broke out.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

806,"Well, I think what happened was, was I think it really got down on my mom. She just had really a tough time trying to work out a menu, try to keep the workers happy with supper and this and that. And of course, you had different nationality, you don't know what to cook and this and that, you're not used to it. Now, if you worked, if you lived out there and was born out there, you knew what, what their fare was. But I think her coming in there and just cold turkey trying to figure that all out, and trying to change the menu and keep 'em happy, I think it overwhelmed her. Although I never heard that, but this is just my thoughts.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

[Laughs] But she used to bring home all the, all the trimmings and stuff, like she used to put it in a little bag and bring some broccoli home. And we had broccoli almost every night, but we learned to eat it, we learned to eat it and it was pretty good stuff. [Laughs]",Life after removal and during the incarceration

But my dad used to be in, he was bedridden, he always used to say, ""Well, we're going to have a, we've always had a good, good Sunday dinner."" We always had roast beef or something like that.

812,"Well, I had a bicycle and I remember doing shopping for dad or my mom. My dad would tell me, go down and go to the Star Fish Market and get some sardines or get some kind of fish or something like that, get some tofu. I used to be the errand boy. Right now, I think that's why I do most of the grocery shopping in our household. [Laughs] But yeah, they had, they had a pretty good-sized Japanese community there. That's where I learned, in school, I had lot of Japanese friends, but they'll all kind of gravitate, gravitate to each other anyway, you know.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
813,"And so how, how did they accept you? So you're coming in, thirteen, fourteen, and sometimes that's a tough age.

What was it like for you?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
814,"Well, when I first started high school, I was a freshman, ninth grade. And I really didn't know anybody in school, but next thing you know, I got a nomination for president of our freshman class. And I didn't hardly know anybody, you know, I thought, ""Wow."" So there was a coalition of Japanese friends, I guess, that put me up for nomination.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
815,"So this is, this is pretty remarkable. I mean, here you're brand new, the Japanese friends that you're talking about, they all grew up together in Stockton, and they supported you as class president. Why do you think they did that?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
816,"Well, it appears that there was a strong bunch from a little settlement outside of Stockton, French Camp. They didn't have a high school, so the bus used to bring 'em into school. During that second year, they had a new school on the south side of town where we lived. Which meant that all those French Camp people were south, they would all be going to that same school. So I think that's, kind of popular after that. I met all these people and this and that, and then the war broke out.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

820,"Well, being new there, I was probably trying to make friends. And if anybody said hello to me, I would try and make friends with them. And I think that's probably what it was. Because I didn't know anybody in town, just moving in from the country and this and that, and the first time to go to school. It just so happened, I think, that we moved into town just before the school term started.

And I knew one or two of 'em because we went to school in Terminous, and it just so happened that they were sent to that camp. We spent a lot of time up there in the grandstands, it was nice and cool up there because it was the middle of summer, you know. And just staying in your barracks with black tarpaper was unbearable, they had concrete floors and just tarpaper outside and no insulation whatsoever. The windows were minimal-size, maybe. They weren't, maybe eighteen by eighteen or, I don't think they were two feet by two feet, but even at that, they didn't allow for much ventilation. So they spent a lot of time up in the grandstands playing cards, and it was, everybody learned how to play pinochle and 500 and stuff like that, bridge.

Because I'm taking, I take it that a lot of people at Stockton when to another camp, they didn't go to Arizona?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
874,"Yes. The reason for that is most of the people that were, had families in the hospitals went to Arizona. And the majority of the, majority of the people went to Arkansas. But just those people that had family in the hospitals, somebody told me that the reason they sent 'em there was because the weather was warm in the event that they would be released from the hospital. And if they're ever allowed visitation or something, it would be close by. Well, closer than going to Arkansas. But that's the only explanation that I heard, and I suppose it makes sense.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
875,"So you were sent to Gila River, Arizona. So describe that, what was that like?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
876,"Well, when we got there, it was already September, late September, I suppose. School had already started, we got a late start there as far as school goes. It... I had to make new friends there because even those people that had family in the hospital, I didn't know them either. But when we settled in our block, then we all had something in common, so you went around and you met people, of course, in school and this and that, at the mess hall or whatever, you know. Your block is just one big community center, you're in the washroom, you're in the restroom, you're taking a shower or whatever. Later on, just wandering around the camp, just to see what the, how big it was and all that, I met some friends from French Camp, they were all there. So I didn't have to look for any more friends, because all the kids that I went to school with from French Camp had been sent there, too. So it was the beginning of playing football with the guys, and basketball, baseball and stuff like that.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

878,"No, I don't think so. There wasn't that much to do, you know. If you went around, I suppose that lot of, lot of 'em went around trying to pilfer pieces of lumber to build things, but that was because they had lumber scraps here and there. And I don't know whether they just allowed anybody to go in there, but they used to go in there at nighttime and take some pieces of lumber to built porches and stuff for their little barracks, maybe build a, a swamp cooler, you'd be surprised at the ingenuity. They'd take a piece of wood and make it into something, they'd find piece here and a piece there and build things with it.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
879,So explain what a swamp cooler is. What's a swamp cooler?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
880,"Well, a swamp cooler is, you know, it got to 110, 120 degrees there in the summertime in Arizona. And a swamp cooler is nothing more than a box built on the outside, maybe the box would be a cubic yard lined with excelsior, and they would run water down through the excelsior with a, with an electric motor and a fan inside so that it'd blow the water cooled air through the excelsior into the barracks, and it'd cool you off. And in this dry climate, what you do is cool air with water, liquid, and it dries right, it dries when it comes in. If you was in Seattle doing something like that, you'd invite yourself to an extra handful of mold, you know.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

882,"Well, on a typical day, just too lazy to get up and eat breakfast at the mess hall, and usually all they had was just oatmeal and toast and some dried eggs and apple butter or orange marmalade, never varied. Matter of fact, there was some older guys used to call themselves the ""Apple Butter Boys."" [Laughs] Anyway, so my mom used to -- oh, they used to have some salted ham, but my mom used to bring some toast and some ham back, and so if you wanted to, dried toast, you put some marmalade or something on it. For lunchtime, they didn't really allow other, outside people to go to different mess halls, and I think a lot of it was quality control, some places you'd have a real good cook, and he could take... the food that came in was all requisitioned from the warehouse and it was all the same stuff. But sometimes the cook could make the difference on what it, what you fed 'em, how they'd prepare it and things like that. But I think that they drew enough rations for so many people in your barracks, and if you went outside of that, why, you created a shortage somewhere, so they always discouraged that. Some places they even had a little things that you had to show 'em that you lived in that block. They had a water container on the... but the faucet used to stick out from the mess hall. They used to have water in there and they'd drop ice in there from the inside so you couldn't get the ice, but you could get the ice water. So that was your water supply. You go in there and get the jug and fill up your water. The boys in the neighborhood, they, in our block, they built a horizontal bar for exercising. I used to work out on there, we had, we used to have one guy in there that was a, quite a, quite a good worker on the horizontal bars, he could flip and do all kinds of things on that. So we used to try to do whatever he showed us to do, work on the bars. Outside of that, we're talking in the summertime, go play football or something like that, baseball. We used to have a block team, and all the other blocks, if they had enough boys interested in it, they would also have a block team and we would go play them. That was about it. The older boys used to have a baseball team that used to play the other teams in the camp, and they were quite good. They had some boys that knew how to play ball pretty good. Most of those guys were probably in their early twenties, you know, all out of school, played good baseball.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

884,"Well, school life was, here we go, making new friends again, because you didn't know anybody. You might know somebody from French Camp or somebody in your own block. But you learned how to make new friends again, and I remember I took Spanish for two years, I was president of the Spanish Club. And the first time I ever ate a taco, first time I ever ate a tamale. We had a schoolteacher that lived in, in Chandler or someplace, adjoining town, and he introduced us to some of the Mexican food, tacos. He never brought us any tamales but he showed us, you know, brought us tacos, tamales -- sorry, tortillas. And corn tortillas, flour tortillas, beans, one time he brought some chili and some beans, and we had a little feast there. And just a sample, you know, but he showed us what those were. Most of us, some of those people from California were already introduced to that stuff, but people from northern California weren't introduced to tacos or anything like that yet.

And they had also said that I could work for my board in room, working in the cafe, the same Eagle Cafe. And so it was my decision if I wanted to go there or not. I don't think that it was imminent that the camps would be closing in any short time. Nobody knew that at that time. Still, I decided, yeah, I don't want to stay here, I want to go out and see what it's like back home.

I was born in December, so I had to wait a whole year before I went to school. But then half the kids were and the other half weren't, you know. Some were seventeen, some were eighteen. Yeah, lot of my friends had already enlisted, and I don't know what feelings they had at that time. And, but I do know that this one boy, he was in the one year older class, and he had been in the service and got wounded, came home, and he was in one of my classes. But he turned out to be one of the nicest fellows. I knew him from before, but because he was an older person, I really didn't know him all that well or anything, but I knew of him.

When I was a kid, I used to fight in the neighborhood, boxing gloves and things like that. And there's, one friends, they used to have a cousin that used to fight in the Golden Gloves, and I always used to have the, I was always chosen to be his sparring mate 'til I decked him one time.

My cousin, she wanted to inquire about where her mother lived and things of that nature, and she said that her mother, course, they lived in California. But my aunt moved to California but she never did want to go back to Scottsbluff, and her kids asked her and she said, ""I don't want to go back to Scottsbluff."" So consequently, they didn't know anything about Scottsbluff, but they wanted to know, they came to me 'cause I was her buddy-buddy, you know. And she says they wanted to know where they lived, what they did and things of that nature, so we went there for a couple days. I tried to point out some of the farms and stuff that they lived at and things of that nature. We met, I called a couple of my friends and they're a lot older than I am, but they took us out to where they thought the farm was, and the farm was, buildings all knocked down already, but they had a good feeling about where their, where her folks had farmed. But these two guys that I called was in the service, and they spent their entire war at Fort Warren, which is in Cheyenne, and they were one of those people that they hear about that used to mow the lawn and stuff like that, and they spent the whole war there.

Hirazawas are no longer there. Joe Kakuda used to be married to my, my cousin, I don't believe nobody in his family farmed.

So when we were taking basic training, they kept telling us, ""We're still fighting over there, we're still fighting over there."" And so, you know, do your training real hard, no goofing off and all that kind of stuff. Of course, I think August, before our basic training officially ended, why, the war with Japan was over.

They had a dozen Japanese restaurants, they had a couple portrait photography shops, they had a couple of fish markets, couple grocery stores with Japanese goods, employment office, they had a number of things here that we never had here before. Of course, when I say before, when my dad was ill, we came to Denver a couple times, and my recollection when I was maybe eleven, twelve years old, something like that. And it was just from one side of the street to the other side of the street, maybe a block long and that was all. There was a family here, he was a doctor, Dr. Miyamoto, and I do not know the relationship between my him and my dad, but they were very, very good friends. So whenever we used to come to Denver, we would always have to go and visit Dr. Miyamoto. And it's just like family, so I don't know what the relationship was, but there was so many other... it was really weird. They have a pool hall, they had a couple pool halls, and it's just like another little town here, just right down here on a couple streets. Couple barbers, couple beauty shops, and right now, when you go there, there's one beauty shop, I think there's still one barber, there was only one grocery store, couple restaurants, maybe three restaurants. There's 20th Street and there's Yoko's... maybe only two restaurants left.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

952,"I, I think that there were some bigger companies, I think there was an S. Ban company here in town. There was another company here in town that handed lot of the goods, food, things from the coast. This was their branch office type of thing. Other than that, there wasn't a whole lot of Japanese businesses, although they, there was a good population of Japanese here. But right now, it seems like our Japanese town is not as big as it was then. 'Course, I have to also say that Japanese are dispersed all throughout, they've assimilated. And the businesses have done the same thing, there's insurance companies out here, there's one out here, there's... and then, of course, the Asian influx, there's the Korean markets and Thai markets. You know, they're all Asian, they keep the same type of goods for all the nationalities.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
953,"So going back to right after the war, when it was a large population, where did all the Japanese and Japanese Americans come from?",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
954,"Well, they came from the camps. And then they relocated here, like Amache was about two hundred, two hundred miles south of Denver. And lot of those people came out around their work release. You know, they came out to work, they went to Wyoming, they went to Nebraska, the same thing happened up in Idaho, Minidoka. People went to Montana to farm, they went to Wyoming, many places. They went to work sugar beets and whatnot. Then they came back in the wintertime and they went back out again. 'Course, I think when the camps closed, if the people didn't have holdings back to where they lived before, lot of 'em just stayed out here. They kind of got to know the people, they got to, some of 'em were short of a job when they come out, and you know, those kind of things. There's quite a few people here from Amache. I wouldn't say a lot, but there's people here from Amache. Chicago has a lot of people from the Arkansas camps, they still live there.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
955,"And so you had this sort of combination of, of people who were here before the war, a sizeable community, and then you have this influx of people from the camps. How did the two groups get together? Did you notice any friction between the two groups?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
956,"Not really. I think the only friction was with the Kibeis. And they had a, they marched to the beat of a different drummer, so to speak. And I know even in camp, when we had problems, it was always with the Kibeis. And they used to have a few things here with the Kibeis here, but they really never got it going. Every once in a while, you'd hear of some Kibeis, but then eventually I think most of those went back to California.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

961,"With the Kibei. What, when you mentioned they would ""try to get something going,"" what would that be?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
962,"Well, yeah, it appears that a lot of it had to do with the, joining the service. And, ""Don't let the United States push you around,"" and this and that. They seemed to, to recall that they seemed to forget. These Niseis over here don't know anything else. They'd never been to Japan to be brainwashed or anything. That's what, that's what we thought, ""These guys have all been brainwashed in Japan."" People over here, the Niseis, they don't know anything like that, you know.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
963,And so was this happening during the war or after the war?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
964,"During the war. In camps, it happened a lot. Yeah, even in the camps in the first assembly centers, they had some problems with some of those Kibeis. Then I don't know, it appears that the Kibeis that were always starting the trouble weren't family people. They were mostly young, younger bachelor type, non-married, and maybe that's what, they needed something to do. But it always appeared that it was always the Kibeis that was... [laughs].",Life after removal and during the incarceration
965,"And so after the war, so this was happening, sort of, during the war, these tensions. Did you see any of that after the war? Say between people that, yeah, between, as you mentioned, Kibei or any other groups? Did you see tension?",Life after removal and during the incarceration
966,"No, not so much. I would have to say that lot of the Kibeis had to forget, they had other things to do, and that was, one, to make a living. And a lot of 'em went chick sexing, that was, I know a lot of Kibeis did chick sexing. But they would have to go back east where a lot of the poultry farms were, Georgia, Pennsylvania, they went to school in Lancaster or something like that, up there in, someplace up there in Pennsylvania, they had a big chick sexing school where you learned how to, you know, determine what the sex of the chickens were, chicks. And, but I do know that a lot of the Kibeis I got to know, that's what they were doing. And I think a lot of 'em just determined, found out that, ""Hey, I have to go work for a living, I can't hang around the pool halls all the time.""

He was an observing person, but he wasn't a warm person as far as I'm concerned. Min Yasui was from Hood River; he was an attorney. We made him an honorary member of American Legion, but Min did a lot for the Japanese people here. He did a lot for the American Legion, offering opinions and this and that.

972,"Well, a lot of people that I knew, the younger ones, resented the fact that the JACL in the first place didn't appreciate the Japanese being taken off the coast and relocated to the Salt Lake area. They, from what I know, they didn't, they weren't for that, they didn't want them to relocate up there. Here again, this country's gotten smaller and smaller, the whole world has gotten smaller and smaller, and I think there was a lack of communication in those days. From my own experience, people in California were, like from a different country than people from the interior. And I guess I can say at this point -- and I've changed -- is that because of that, there was this discrimination. Because the people in Salt Lake didn't know the people on the coast. I myself from the interior went to California, I didn't know those people. They were different. Some of those places, just like what I hear about being in Japan, they had outdoor furo, you know, the bathhouses and all that kind of stuff, we never, ""What's that?"" you know. That's, seemed like it come from a foreign country. But they had lot of those customs they retained there. They had more of a closer tie to Japan than people from the interior, and I think that's because there was more Japanese there and they intermingled more. They pretty much spoke the same language, whereas people out here, why, you're next door neighbor is ten miles away or something like that, that spoke Nihongo.

So a lot of the leadership of the JACL was located in Salt Lake City, and you're saying because they didn't understand, really, the Japanese on the coast as much, that was one of, you think, the reasons why the JACL was more... what's the right word?

980,"Well, I think the people up here, when they went to dance, I think some of them learned how to do the proper steps, and then the people from California didn't dance properly. They had what they called the shuffle and things like that, and I think that was the difference. And so we didn't jitterbug up here. It just seemed like it was, started with the California shuffle, it wasn't exactly like a, it was like a slow jitterbug type of thing. And then when I was in camp, they used to have dance classes, and the women's P.E. teacher used to do that. So she'd want so many of the boys to come from their P.E. classes, and the girls would all have to be there. So she learned us the foxtrot and the waltz and stuff like that, and I kind of liked that.

982,"Oh, yeah.",Life after removal and during the incarceration
983,How would you characterize that? This is interesting.,Life after removal and during the incarceration
984,"Absolutely. My, my oldest sister, she's deceased now, but we used to go visit them quite often in California. But their whole life spins around a lot of Japanese things. They got the big Japanese stores there, and of course, they belong to the Buddhist temple there and lot of their friends. But at her age, she still knows a lot of Nihongo, still is able to read Nihongo. They have closer ties to things from Japan, because there's a strong, there still is a stronger culture there just merely because a lot of the Japanese companies have settled there. And they have a lot of cultural programs and things of that nature. Whereas out here, we're more Anglicized. You still have some Japanese culture like the Hanamatsuri and stuff like that, but that's our only touch with that Japanese. 'Cause my granddaughter, she dances with the Bukkyokai, and during their programs, she's one of those that dances on the stage, and she just loves it.

My sister, she's always been on that committee, so she's always introducing me to people that are on, her coworkers on the committees and this and that. And I really don't feel any difference cultural-wise. Because the culture doesn't really show up there.

And then that goes on, and here you are, you're looking at your great grandkids. We have done everything that we were able to do for our children. And I think one of the strongest things that Japanese families have is to take care of your family. And by the same token, it's reciprocal, it comes back to you. So I got daughters that dote on me, and a son that dotes on me, and kids that dote on me. And by the same token, we're doting on our kids, too.

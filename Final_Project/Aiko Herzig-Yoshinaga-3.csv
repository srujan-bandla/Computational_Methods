358,"I think my parents protected us from knowing how really hard it was for us. I recall my mother working from morning to night, taking care of us, making our clothes from hand-me-downs, and actually, I think I thought I was, our family was rather well-off because my parents permitted me to take tap dance and ballet lessons, something that was quite a treat, and something that was rather unusual, I think, among Japanese families at the time. And so, later on, when I found out we could barely make the rent, and yet my parents were permitting me to have these lessons, I felt very privileged and spoiled, and grateful for my parents' consideration of my needs.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

She herself played the shamisen, the three-stringed instrument that looked like a banjo. And also, the koto, the thirteen-stringed instrument. She, I think my father, also, although he was not musical, he appreciated, he loved it. He loved to have music in the house. I feel the rest of my brothers and sisters were also quite musical. I had an older sister who sang, played the piano. Another sister who played the piano. My brother, older brother played a violin. So all of us were able to do something in the music line. When we bought the piano, I tell you, the house was so happy. Of course, my family was very Christian so the first compositions played were always hymns, were the hymnals. I think that perhaps I should mention here, at the time that we were removed from our homes, we had to sell the piano for next to nothing, I think it was something like ten dollars, including all the music.

I could never be Betty Grable with long beautiful limbs, blond hair, blue eye.

Of course, at the mom-, at that time, we didn't know how it would actually affect us, but we knew it would be affecting us in some way. The party broke up, we all went home. And I think our parents took it much harder because, as you know, as most -- perhaps a lot of people don't know -- that persons of Japanese ancestry who were immigrants were not permitted to become American citizens at that time, in 1942. This didn't change until 1952, ten years later, when they were finally permitted to become American citizens. My father and mother had been here a number of years, but by law, they were, could not become naturalized citizens.

We did not think -- at least I didn't, and I think many of us who were second-generation Japanese, Nisei -- didn't think much about what would be happening to us. We were concerned about our parents. We thought we were American citizens, therefore we were protected. We were protected by the Constitution to continue to have the freedom, the liberty that we, all Americans have a right to.

I think they knew that we would be hurt if they ostracized us. On the other hand, just like our neighbors who lived around us, I believe that they felt if they were too friendly with us, they would be labeled ""Jap-lovers."" Therefore, our friends, our schoolmates were caught in a little dilemma. I think there were those who didn't care what other Caucasians or blacks felt. They were friends, and they remained friends and played with us. But on the whole, it became harder and harder for them to remain our friends. We were treated with a sort of disdain. I think we were stigmatized simply because of, of our ethnicity. And I think that that's one of the most painful experiences, the feelings about the entire wartime experience. That we were judged, not on our own character as people and persons, but simply because of our ethnicity, something that I think goes against the grain of democracy, of the Constitution and every right and privilege that we're supposed to enjoy as American citizens.

The curfew that the army imposed upon, upon us was, see, I forget the date of it, but I remember that we were not allowed to be outside of our homes after 8 o'clock at night or before 6 o'clock in the morning. And that curfew covered the territory, it was like 5 miles from our own home. If we had to leave beyond 5 miles, I believe we had to have a permit from the government, from the army, probably, that would permit us to be outside of our home area, which was beyond 5 miles. This curfew was also imposed upon German and Italian aliens. At the very beginning, I believe the government, especially, I would say the government -- when I say ""government,"" I really mean the army -- were strict about this curfew and they enforced it rather broadly. But as weeks went on, it was very apparent that the curfew was meant especially for those of Japanese ancestry.

380,"The order for us to be moved away from our home was signed by President Roosevelt and became effective on February 19, 1942. The order actually said, military commanders -- of which there were a number -- the Eastern Defense Command, Southern, Central, Western -- the commanders are authorized to designate certain areas as military zones, or prohibited zones, from which they may exclude whomever they feel should be prohibited from their areas. It was a very broad, direct authority. That authority was... President Roosevelt gave that authority to the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, who then passed down this permission to prohibit, to set up military zone, and prohibit certain, any persons they thought should not be in those areas, transferred that authority to the individual command generals. And on the West Coast, it was a general whose name was John L. DeWitt, who took advantage of this authority and declared certain areas as prohibited and restricted areas. He was afraid, I believe, that he might get caught in the same kind of situation that General Short and Admiral Kimmel found themselves in after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As you know, they were court-martialed and General DeWitt wanted to make sure he was going to be ready for any invasion by the Japanese forces. And so he went overboard to try to cover his flank and never to be put in the same position as those, the general and the admiral in Pearl, at Pearl Harbor.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

I believe it was in March of 1942, that... mid-March, a little after mid-March, when the first exclusion order, which affected the Bainbridge Island people, right off Seattle, Washington, they were the first group who were ordered to move. And I think they had about a week's notice to move to... and I think that that city, as in other cities later, these notices to move were posted, tacked onto either telephone poles, put up at post offices, displayed at churches and community centers that existed, and that was the way most of us found out. We were all given orders, the head of the family was given an order to report to a certain location to get instructions on when that particular family would be expected to be out of the house, to be moved to a reception center, or assembly center, by the army -- which was run by the army.",Life after removal and during the incarceration

We were all frantic about where each one of us would be moving to. Los Angeles was a big area, it was divided into different sections. Certain areas would be, were told they would be going somewhere, no name, but a certain section of, inland. And therefore, since the army did not notify each family exactly where they would be going, what kind of weather they would be encountering, or exactly when they would be moving, efforts within the, each family started to roll, to get rid of, to sell or to store their household goods. And then trying to separate out what they thought they would need and what they thought they could either store or sell. It was a hectic, frantic time for all the Japanese families. In our family, my father, as a matter of fact, destroyed all of his Japanese language books because rumors spread that if the FBI came to your home and found Japanese language books, your father or uncle, or mother would be taken away and fear just gripped the community over things like that. My father destroyed almost all of his Japanese language books, including a book that he had written -- he had a number of copies of a autobiography my sister said he had written. Also, he had been carrying around the ashes of one of my sisters, a half-sister, and my mother told me many, many years later that he had buried those ashes in the backyard of our home in Los Angeles. She didn't know where, what part of the yard. I've often thought of going back to that house, but I didn't know how to approach the occupant of the house to ask if I could dig up his backyard to look for the ashes of my sister my father had buried fifty years ago.

And the neighbors, the persons, the non-Japanese who were not moving, being asked to move, knew that the shorter time we had to leave, the more willing we would be to lower our prices. So there were ""vultures"" all around, hanging around for days, waiting for the day that we would move, and that we would literally have to give things away. My mother, of course, had some small items, beautiful little dishes from Japan, and I think some heirlooms that she decided to sell -- brooches, obitome -- things like that that I, I know that she had to get rid of, to sell, because she felt we must take what is absolutely necessary as long as we were permitted to take only what we could carry, at the time. And I have heard many stories of mothers who were so furious at the insulting prices that were offered by buyers, that they rather, rather than sell them at these prices, they would break the dishes or the big platters that they cherished so much. I believe those who left for the camps early on did not have the opportunity, or the knowledge at the time, or the permission by the government, that they could store some things.

We were able to reach the pinnacle of scholarly success for high school students by becoming members of the California Scholarship Federation, which was quite a thing at the time. And all of us worked very hard to be good students, to be good citizens. Therefore, after working for twelve years to reach the top of the mountain to graduate, after having lived through and in this hostile environment, then to have our high school principal talk to us like that was, in Hayawa Shishino's mind, the most devastating experience of his life, and his bitterness has carried him over all these, with him all these years. I know that I was really disappointed and devastated to think that I wouldn't be able to graduate and wear a cap and gown with all my other Caucasian friends. And to be deprived of those, of that diploma which we worked so hard for was a big blow to us. It was proof that the feeling we had been carrying all the time, sort a self-hatred for not being white, showed its, showed its ugly face and ugly head at that time. I think that I may not be alone in saying that I grew up with a certain amount of self-hatred, I could never be Betty Grable, I hated not to be blond, I hated not to, to enjoy the kind of attention that blonds got.

He wrote, after all those years, after those decades, he wrote to the Los Angeles Board of Education and complained about the treatment he and our fifteen other members of our class received during the summer of 1942. And fortunately there was a young Japanese American on the Board of Education at that time, who took his complaint and his grievance seriously. He discussed the situation with other members of the Board of Education of Los Angeles and made arrangements to have a wonderful ceremony for those who were, who still survived from the, that class of summer 1942 in Los Angeles High School, and had a wonderful ceremony in Los Angeles High School for those of us who are now grandparents and great-grandparents. And oh, the funny part of this whole thing was that the member of the Board of Education whom Mr. Shishino contacted was my son-in-law. So he, when my son-in-law found out that I was a member of the class, of course, he made a special effort to make sure that this happened. And so we were presented our 1942 diplomas in 1989, I think it was. And that seemed to have set a trend, because I know that after that, other cities up and down the West Coast did the same thing. And even UC Berkeley, I think, two years ago, had a ceremony, and UCLA, a ceremony to honor those who would have gotten their degrees, or who were dishonored at that time and the school wanted to make up for it.

410,"Yes. As I got off the bus, I could not believe that people were going to live in a place like that. I'd never seen a desert before and there was no civilization. It was just barren, sagebrush-filled area. And it was so depressing. I think the parents, the Issei, were happy to be there simply because at least they were together with their family and they weren't separated from their children. And I must say, many of the Issei had some free time for the first time. They didn't have to worry about getting up at the crack of dawn, farming, or running stores and they did have some free time. But I think they also lost their liberty which to me was one of the biggest deprivations that we suffered those three or four years.

But it was, I guess it was supposed to be like army fare, but I think it was less nutritious. I'm sure it was. It was boring. And when you have to cook for so many people, I don't think you can ever expect real delicious food, unless you go to a fancy restaurant. Now this was a situation in which each camp prided itself, prided itself -- is that right English? -- on how little they spent for each resident. They would report back to the government in Washington, ""We only spent 49 cents per person in our camp."" Some camps would be bragging they only spent 35 cents. So you could tell the quality of the food was not good just by that, the price, virtue alone.

We, I'm sure, although I didn't know anything about hospitals and supplies at the time, but I have read what Japanese doctors who served in the camps said, that they lacked medicine, they lacked the proper equipment to do the necessary work that they needed to do as doctors.

What page the diapers were on, or the, all those necessary things were, in the Montgomery Ward catalogue. We bought diapers -- during those days there were no Pampers or Huggies. We bought diapers through the catalog. Baby clothes, layettes. Of course, it was something. I remember going through these books and thinking well, this costs three dollars, we only get sixteen dollars. How much of that -- what do we have left for the rest of the month? Fortunately, we didn't have to pay rent, or buy our meals, but everything still cost the same for us as for people who lived outside of the camps and they were making a hundred dollars a week -- or maybe not that much -- a hundred dollars a month as opposed to what we were making, sixteen dollars a month. It wasn't easy. I remember being pregnant and saying, ""I've got to have this box of chocolate,"" and order it, wait for two or three weeks, anticipating every day a box of chocolate, and then a notice coming, saying, ""Sorry, we're out of stock.""

Every block had a rec. hall, a recreation hall, and movies would be sent from one block to another block. I remember being at one where there was a fight. And these benches and chairs started to fly around. It was a scary experience. I don't know who instigated the fight, or the reasons for the fight, but twice that kind of thing happened and I remember being whisked away by my then-husband, back to our barracks, because of this kind of problem that existed in the camps during those days.

But if one didn't have money, one couldn't buy anything. So I remember being short on supply of sanitary napkins and making do with whatever I could get a hold of. Of course, once I got pregnant, which was three months into the camp, then that stopped. But there was also the fact of toilet tissues. That was in short supply or sometimes non-existent in the latrines. And I recall we were tearing up magazines and trying to soften them up by rubbing them together -- [laughs] -- and using them.

It was wrong of this country to put us behind barbed wires, place us in prison camps and then expect our men to serve and fight and die for the country.

454,"Okay. So many years after the camps, we were very, very busy trying to rebuild our lives. So we didn't think too much about the past, we tried to put it behind us. Then came along the Civil Rights movement. Our children, by that, third-generation children, Japanese Americans called Sansei, they became, many became involved in the Civil Rights movement and many of these young folks started to ask about their own parents' past, about the camp life, which many Nisei parents never talked about. And there were different reasons in different families for the silence. I was living in New York City at the time. I read a book written by Michi Weglyn, called Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps. I met Michi Weglyn, inspired by her book, and inspired also by a group of other Nisei women with whom I became affiliated in an organization called Asian Americans for Action. Very progressive group, mostly Nisei women. I had never been involved in anything with political connotation to the group's activities as I was in this, this triple-A group. And they were very, very influential in my life, turned my head around, made me start to think about minorities, about injustice, about inequality and it was an eye-opening experience for me to find out more about -- and to think about the camp experience and what it meant to me personally, what it meant to our families, what it meant to our community.",Legal challenges#Life after removal and during the incarceration

457,What are those theories?,Life after removal and during the incarceration
458,"One of the theories that she put forth is the hostage/reprisals theory. Once in the war, it was quite apparent, I think, to the War Department and to the leaders of this country, that they were fighting an enemy, Japanese soldiers, who would never give up. They would rather commit suicide than to be taken prisoners or surrender, which meant America would not have many prisoners of war, American -- Japanese prisoners of war, soldiers or sailors. Whereas Japan already had quite a pool of American citizens who were interned by Imperial Japan. Now, international conventions call for the exchange of prisoners. Here Japan had this huge pool of American citizens, America would not have any prisoners, Japanese prisoners. So if Issei and Nisei -- from the West Coast primarily, because that's where most of the Japanese American community was congregated -- were placed in a holding situation where they could easily be exchanged, picked up and exchanged for American prisoners, that made the situation easier for the State Department to deal with if we were all already in one area. And there are documents in the archives that imply the fact that now this government does have a population of Japanese, ethnic Japanese, on whom reprisals can be taken if Imperial Japan mistreats American soldiers, or American civilians who were interned. There are these documents and Michi Weglyn had discovered them. So it makes a lot of sense to me. So we were hostages. Hostages for exchange purposes or possible, at least threatened, reprisals. That is one of the main premises, I think, of Michi Weglyn's book.",Government’s decision to remove ethnic Japanese#Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

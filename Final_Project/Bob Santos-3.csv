On camera is Dana Hoshide, observing is Casey Ikeda, and I'm the interviewer, Tom Ikeda, and today we're with Bob Santos. And so Bob, I'm just gonna start, why don't you first just tell me when and where you were born?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2519,"I was born in Seattle, Harborview Hospital, to my parents, Sammy and Virginia Santos.",Military services#Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2520,"So why don't you tell me, so Sammy Santos, and tell me where he was born and how he came to the United States?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2521,Okay. Now it's gonna be a little long 'cause there's a little story to tell.,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2522,"He just jumps ship, literally jumps ship?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2523,"Yeah, when they got near, or when they were docking in San Diego, for some reason he got away and he jumped ship. That's what I hear. I don't know how long, and he never told me how long he was in the brig, but it must've been a year or two years, and when he got out he didn't have any skills.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2524,"Okay, so making sure, so he jumped ship and then they caught him?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2525,"No, not yet.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2526,"Okay, so how, but he was in the brig, though?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2527,"No, he was in the brig on the ship.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2528,So there was a large Japanese community down there. Did he fight against Japanese? Was that part of...,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2529,"I don't, I don't know that. I know he, in his old clippings, most of the names were American, white fighters, maybe black fighters. I didn't see any Asian fighters. But he got to be pretty good and he became a main eventer. He worked his way up to eight rounds and ten round, ten round matches. And he fought under the name of Sammy Santos. When he jumped ship he had changed his name, so he just changed his first name to Sammy Santos. And at that time, of course, there's a lot of boxers, a lot of prize fighters who were Filipino. Some Japanese, some Chinese, not very many, but a lot of Filipinos. Pound for pound, they could match up with anybody, and so they became, there was quite a circle of boxers, of prize fighters who came from the Philippines, and my dad was one of them. And there was a couple of champions at that same era, a guy named Speedy Dado and a guy named Marino. They were both champions in their divisions, and I forgot, lighter, the lighter divisions. So Sammy starts winning these fights and then he starts to get publicized, and then the navy says, hey, I think that's the guy we're lookin' for. That's Macario. So my dad got picked up at, he says he was fighting a match, he says, ""I was winning,"" and the shore patrol waited until he, the fight ended and he won the fight, and then they grabbed him and they put him in the brig in San Diego. Dad would never say how long he was in that brig, or that jail, but when he got out, of course, he resumed his boxing career. And there were a lot of Filipinos, a lot of boxers in his weight in this southern California area, so he started --",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2530,"Backing up just a little bit, I'm curious, so when someone, like, jumps ship and it's kind of a military, you're in the military and they do this, is this on their record? Like in the same way a felony conviction would be in terms of civil and so that it's hard to get jobs or it's part of your record that you have to always report? Is that part of what he had to do?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2531,"Yes. Yeah. That would be part. I guess he'd be a felon in today's... and I don't know what the charges and the disposition of his trial if he had one, so we don't know that.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2532,"Now, when he sort of talks about those years, any story that comes to mind that kind of captures the life of a boxer on the road doing this?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2533,"Well, yeah, the biggest fight towns were towns, at least on the West Coast, where a lot of minority, fighters from the minority community, the black community, Jewish community, and Asian community, where you had populations, say, a lot of Filipinos. He fought in Stockton, California, and a lot of the migrant workers there, or the farm workers, are Filipino, so any time there was a boxing match in Stockton, California, all the Filipinos would show up at the arena for the fights. So many times the arenas were filled up with Filipinos or other ethnic communities if they had an ethnic fighter. I mean, the whole community would come out. And the promoters noticed that, and so they were promoting fights in all the major cities in California where a big Filipino population was, and Seattle had a large Filipino population because of the seafood industry, lot of the Filipinos were brought here as domestics, mostly men. They worked in the farmlands in eastern, central and eastern Washington, so they would end up in Seattle.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2534,"So did your father have, these stories, so like at Stockton, for instance, or any community where there's a large Filipino community, so when he fought, how was he treated by the community?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2535,"Well, the main community, the white community, the sports followers, the followers of sports, they would support the local fighters, boxers, local fighters and if they brought someone from out of town that they were, if you're fighting in Stockton and you brought someone in from San Francisco, the local fighters, the ones in Stockton would be the heroes, right, the hometown guys. Unless it was a white guy. And so the Stockton crowd would root for the white guy from San Francisco rather than the Filipino guy from Stockton, but they would be all outnumbered because there'd be more Filipinos at the boxing matches. So he wound his way up to Seattle 'cause he heard Seattle was a good fight town, lot of Filipinos, and he knew that he would be among the main eventers, the elite boxers, in the lightweight, he was a lightweight division fighter. And so there was a guy named Nate Druxman. Nate Druxman was a jeweler in downtown Seattle, and he was a boxing promoter and he latched onto my dad and became my dad's promoter. And this is now, we're talking about the mid '20s, at least 1924, '25, '26, in that era there, and there happened to be quite a few Filipino fighters when he came to town, but he sort of rose above those guys and became their buddies, their heroes. And I don't know the exact number of boxers, but I looked through the old scrapbook and I see at least five or six Filipino guys in the photos that the family had taken. A guy named Joe Calder and a couple other guys, and so Dad was, had his group of buddies and he seemed to be the leader of the, of the group.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2536,"And when you look through these scrapbooks, where in Seattle were they, would they fight?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2537,"There were two boxing arenas. One was the Civic Center and one was the armory, and the armory must've been on, right where the Pike market is. I don't know if it was on Western Avenue or the street below Western. It had to be on Western Avenue. And then there was an old swimming pool called the Crystal Pool, Second Avenue and, I don't know the cross street. The facade of the old Crystal Pool is still there on Second Avenue and they built a whole apartment building above it, but they preserved that, the facade of the first, first floor. So I remembered him taking me to the old Crystal Pool and showing me around, and I think it was after his boxing days, but I remembered the gymnasium was set over the pool. Swimming, the water at Crystal pool, they'd get it up from Puget Sound and became a fresh, saltwater pool, and then I don't know, I think boxing probably became more popular so that was probably a better money making venue.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2538,And then made that a boxing ring?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2539,Yeah.,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2540,"Now, when you say there was, like, controversy, I mean, controversy like people say, oh, the fight was fixed, or things like that? Is that the kind of stuff that people talk about?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2541,"Well, that, a lot of that was happening then, but it didn't seem like that, the controversy on fixing fights came a little bit later. I remember my uncle Joe and my dad talking about a guy named Frankie Carbo coming into town, and after Frankie came into town the Northwest, Tacoma had a middleweight champion by the name of Freddy Steele, and Seattle had a middleweight champion by the name of Al Hostow. That's when Frankie Carbo was managing both of these fighters, so there were payoffs and stuff like that. But getting back to Sammy, I looked at his, we looked up his record, and his record, partial record that they document was forty-six wins, twenty-two losses, and eleven draws, so that was pretty good. And he was quite a puncher, so most of his forty-six wins were by knockout, so if he couldn't knock the guy out the guy would probably win. Part of the twenty-two losses were by points. He was never knocked out or he, according to him, or never knocked down, so I sort of believe him.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2542,"So what was your mother's name, and where did she come from?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2543,"Okay. Virginia Nicol, N-I-C-O-L, Virginia Nicol was born in Nanaimo, Canada. That's on Vancouver Island, just an hour drive north of Victoria. Beautiful area, if you've ever been to Nanaimo.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2544,"Right, the ferry terminal. Yes. And it was several large timber mills there and lumber mills, and that's where my grandfather, Virginia's dad, Cornelio Nicol from the Philippines, settled in Nanaimo, Canada. He didn't come to Seattle. He was one of the very few Filipinos who went to Nanaimo, Canada. We could never trace his name, Nicol, the Nicol family in the Philippines. Couldn't find whether there's a Nicol family and it was always a question mark, what tribe did he come from? And a couple years ago Sharon Tomiko and I drove up to, drove up to the ferry up in Vancouver and took the ferry over to Nanaimo, and the front street when you drive into Nanaimo from the ferry depot, ""Nicol."" Now, Nanaimo leaders didn't, didn't name their street after my grandpa. Grandpa was running from something, somebody, and he changed his name. So we figured he didn't come to Seattle like most Filipinos; he went up to Canada, I think to hide. And so, ""Ah, that's my name,"" so he changed his name to Nicol. And he married, he married a woman that was part French Canadian and part Native Canadian, Indian, and while in Nanaimo, of course, Sharon, a history sort of major, she starts checkin' out this family, and she finds out that Virginia's grandfather came from Quebec, a guy named LeBeouf. He comes to the Northwest, he comes to British Columbia from Quebec, and he meets a woman, a beautiful woman, Native woman from Alaska named Mary. We don't know her last name. So their children, Caroline is my great-grandmother, and Caroline's daughter, Adeline, her daughter was my (grandmother).",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2548,"Okay, so we have Virginia Nicol up in Nanaimo, so how does she meet your father?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2549,"That's what, I guess when the climate was a little bit cooler Grandpa figured he could come, come down to Seattle. And he had two daughters, Virginia and Antonia, and they were, they must've been in elementary school when he moved to Seattle, moved from Nanaimo to Seattle. So some of the photos -- and he, what he did was he moved from Nanaimo to Bainbridge Island in the very early '20s -- and some of the photos that my mom kept, she's about six, seven years old in those classroom, those class photos in Bainbridge. And they went to the schools in Port Blakely. That's where she grew up, next to the lumber, the timber mill in Port Blakely. There was a large timber mill there. That's, the family grew up in that area. A lot swimming. And for some reason, during the later '20s, it must've been, it must've been nineteen, mid 1920s when Grandpa decided to bring the girls to Seattle to go to school, Broadway High School and then to University of Washington. Of course, they all ended through that way.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2550,"I should back up a little bit, so not only Broadway High School, but they, your mother attended the University of Washington?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2551,"Yes, for a short while. I don't think she ever graduated. I think she got married in, you know, real... she went to Broadway High School, and she would work during the summertime and then save enough money to go to University of Washington, to save enough money for tuition. And she worked in a restaurant in the International District called the Rizal Cafe. I cannot find what side of the, King Street the Rizal Cafe was. My feeling was Rizal Cafe must've been in the Atlas Hotel building.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2552,"Yes. So they got married and started a family almost, soon after they got married. They must've gotten married in 1930, '30 or '31, and their first son, Sammy Junior, was born in 1932, and that's when my dad quit fighting, in that year. I think it was 1932. His last, we have an article about him. I guess he quit for a while. My father had lost eyesight in one of his eyes due to boxing injuries. You know resin that they had on the canvas? Some would fall down and they wouldn't wipe it off, and so the boxers would get the resin in their eyes from the boxing gloves. And so my father, his eyes started to deteriorate, both of 'em, but he lost sight in his left eye, and I think that's when he quit boxing. He couldn't pass the medical exams for the matches, so in 1932 he had four or five fights in Spokane, and soon after that he retired from boxing. And I have an article from those last four, five fights. Someone came up with that article and sent it to me about a year ago, so that was --",Legal challenges#Pre-war background to the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2558,"In nineteen, you were born 1934, right?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2559,"Yes, and that's when she had this disease. And she refused to leave me to go to the sanatorium at Firland, sanatorium up north. The doctors wanted to put her in a sanatorium to cure that lung disease and she, she refused to go, so you know how tuberculosis works, it just got worse, and she passed away in 1935, April of 1935 when I was about fourteen months old. So my brother and I, my dad couldn't handle both of us. We were two years, I was two years old, he was three years old, and he, being a widower then, he just couldn't handle it. So I was taken by my aunt and Uncle Joe Adriatico, who lived in the central area. My mother's sister, Auntie Toni. And my brother was taken in by our great-grandmother, Caroline Gilbert, who came from Canada and settled in Tacoma. So they split us up. My brother was raised in Tacoma and I was raised in Seattle with my aunt and uncle, and then on weekends and holidays and any time I could I would stay with my dad in Chinatown, Manila Town in the International District. And in 1945 --",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2561,"Well, when my dad and mom first got, when they got married, we see that there's a home that they purchased through his boxing, through his winnings, in the Ravenna neighborhood. There's some old photos of this old brown house in the Ravenna neighborhood, and Sammy and Virginia and others in the family lived in that house. I think about that same time when my dad quit boxing and there was no, there was no income coming in, I think they moved to the International District. And there was a couple of photos of me and my brother. I'm a toddler and he's about two years old, and we're sitting on the stoop, or the steps, of the old James Hotel on James Street, right now where the freeway is.

2563,"It also could've been that maybe the Chinese and Japanese, when they came they were more productive than the Filipinos who came that were just brought in for domestic work. They, most of the Filipinos immigrated to Hawaii. They were brought in by the plantation owners to work the fields, and then from there they would hop from Hawaii to Seattle, because not only the agricultural industry but also the seafood industry was very popular then. And Asian workers, Japanese, Chinese and Filipino workers, would be sent to Alaska during the Alaska, the Alaska salmon runs, and they would work in the canneries to can the salmon. And Filipinos sort of took that industry over after World War II.

2565,"You know, Dorothy and Fred Cordova, they've done a lot of research on that and it just, it's gone over my head. The reasons why, the years that that happened, it was just, it wasn't just the women, but there was an exclusion act on Filipinos in those, I don't know, early '30s until nineteen, until the war, and then in the mid '40s more of those, of the Filipinos started to immigrate into the United States.",Life after removal and during the incarceration#Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And when I would go down and visit my dad, and he 'd take, my brother and I would come from, my brother would come Tacoma and we'd visit. My dad became a boxing trainer. He became a trainer, and it was a gymnasium on Seventh and Pike. Seventh Avenue Gym was on the second floor and it was run by this guy named Nate Druxman. My dad had retired. He became a trainer, and he actually trained some championship fighters. And he would bring my brother and I to the gymnasium, and after all the professionals, they would do their workouts and hitting the bag and sparring and stuff, he put the gloves on my brother and I, right, and we'd go out there in the ring and we'd just slug it out. And he was older than I, so he'd always make me cry, and the guys would throw in money, but they'd throw 'em to me, right? A dime, a nickel, a quarter, sometimes maybe even fifty cents, was big money at that time, so I scooped up all this money.

But that wasn't part of our community.

I remember performing at one the nightclubs, doing the tinikling. You remember the bamboo dance? Us kids when we were growing up had to learn all the cultural, the Filipino dances, and so when we were kids they'd bring us to the nightclubs in the International District to perform during intermission, when the jazz musicians would take their breaks.

Never, my, the kids in my age group growing up never talked about treatment. It didn't seem like they were talking about the treatment. They were talking about the bad conditions, the bad food. I think they were a little bit young, we were a little bit younger, so they, their brothers, Mike Matsudaira and John Matsudaira, went into the 442nd. Mike never came back, so we'd talk about losing Mike. When I -- and I was baptized a Catholic at Maryknoll -- when I was confirmed I chose the name of Michael after Michael Matsudaira. He was my hero when I was a little kid. So we talked a little bit about some of the neighbor kids that weren't coming back, and they weren't, our kids weren't really telling us, the Filipino kids, just were talking among themselves and we were part of that group. It was just sharing stories among themselves about some of the things that, that came to their minds. A lot of was conditions, food, and their brothers and sisters that didn't come back.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

And I never saw, I mean, the families might've, might've felt some backlash or seen backlash, but we as kids, me as a kid, never noticed that, that it would be pronounced that I would remember that. It seemed like it, just one day they were gone, one day everything opened up again, and I never thought about what the repercussions were about opening up, about outsiders coming in, yelling and screaming. I didn't see any of that.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

2692,This is Mayor Clinton?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2693,"This is Mayor Clinton. And a couple years after that there was a promotion that went through the district, the rickshaw races in the International District. The first time we ever saw that term, International District, and that sort of caught on. That was in the early '50s that that happened, the rickshaw races. I don't know if you remember that, but I just remember that term. And it was, I think they were running it, I don't know if you know, Seafair was just opening then, 1951 or so, and each neighborhood was having their own little celebrations. We had carnivals in the International District about that same time. Carnival people would come in and they'd put in the Ferris wheel and merry-go-rounds, and all the streets around the International District were bubbling with all this carnival atmosphere. It was sponsored by the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, and then that new group saw sort of a revitalization in Chinatown and they wanted that to happen in the other area of the International District outside of Chinatown.

I just remember his, I remember a program, and it was sponsored by the International Improvement Association, and they had the board of directors and it was Chin Hong from Four Seas, and Ken MacDonald, and Toru Sakahara, Terry Toda, I don't even know if Moriguchi, Tomio was even involved at that point. It was probably a little bit earlier than him. And their goal was to clean up Chinatown/International District, bring in new lighting, fluorescent lighting, revitalize the restaurant industry. They could, I think they could see that we could become a, quote, ""touristy area,"" a Chinatown, a Japantown touristy area much like San Francisco, much like Los Angeles, and they just saw that it could be a revitalization. And this is the '50s now, right after the war.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2698,"That was, and so then when I saw that, we had a couple of issues in the International District when we wanted to protect the area against the Intermodal Transportation Center. You remember that, at Union Station, right after the Kingdome? We fought that. And the person I went to to get support was Ken MacDonald, and he assigned someone to work with us, but he was involved in that, their law firm was involved, starting to get involved in the land use kind of issues.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII

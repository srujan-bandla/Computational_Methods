He was disappointed and when they came around to look for people to go to United States to make money, work in agriculture, he signed up. And so he came to United States and first place they landed was Seattle, so he worked on farms in Seattle and he found out that it was not very profitable because the boss was taking everything, and there was very little. And he kept all of the papers, I guess you would call it the visas or whatever were required, but he decided it was not for him, so he left with all of his personal papers, left and came south. He came as far as San Francisco down to Southern California, Los Angeles, and working all the way, trying to make money on the farms, but it wasn't very, very profitable. He finally wound up in Los Angeles and he started working for the Santa Fe Railroad, and as a result he had some stability in income. He wrote to his sister in Japan.

[Laughs] And we're chasing it and it's kinda comical because the chicken still had a lot of energy. He's still running around. So until you could catch it again, hold it down, it was a, a riot.

So at that time the comics were very popular in junior high school. Superman, Batman, and the Katzenjammer Kids and all. Everybody was trading comic books, and I liked the name of the Batman, Bruce Wayne, so I started using Bruce as my personal name. And it wasn't legal, but I used it every opportunity I could.

So they got me involved in kendo, and we bought our dougu in Little Tokyo and I have a little bamboo dou and a black mat and then a, bought the shinai, or the sword, and started kendo. And it was following everybody's footsteps. The same applied to the other boys in the area. They went into kendo or judo. I didn't like judo.

But there was an exception after the pools were open to the public for so many days, just before they're going to change the water, the last day, they allowed our group to go in and swim. It was very cloudy and dirty, but they allowed us to go. And it was not what you call equal treatment. We're still second class.

2773,"When Nisei Week came around, as you know, it was a promotion that was sponsored by the merchants of Tokyo in order to get business. And what they did was they came up with a plan that if you bought merchandise you would get so many tickets (to vote). And certain areas promoted a candidate and the tickets that you bought represented merchandise you bought in Little Tokyo, and that brought business to the Little Tokyo merchants who then sponsored the various activities. And what you did is got one ticket for every dollar that you bought of merchandise, so the farmers would buy ice box and stoves, and they would save the tickets until towards the end of the promotion. They would stuff the (voting) boxes with (...) the candidate's name on the back and stuff the boxes to get their candidate to be the queen. So it was a successful promotion in that it brought business to Little Tokyo. And it also brought the community together and began to attract the general community, and the Nisei Week and the parade and the ondo (dancing). So all the Boy Scouts participated in the parade and we went first before the parade started. At that time they didn't have any parking meters, and so we would have to go up and down the streets. The cars were parked on curb. We'd have to go inside the restaurants and tell everybody, ""Got to move your car. The parade is gonna start."" And the people would move, move their cars off of the street because we needed all the space for the various parade participants to come down with the crowd sitting on the curb. The Boy Scouts then formed their own units to march, and the Koyasan Boy Scouts had the latest equipment because their merchant parents had the most money. (Yes), they had not only the regular bugles, but they had the piston bugles, and not only the regular drums, they had the tenor drums and the bass drum sets. We had to compete with that. But we had a good instructor for our marching band from Stevenson Junior High, and he came on Friday nights to teach us how to march (...) and also play (...) marching songs. And so we competed with (...) other units. There was a Koyasan, Nichi Hongwanji... I think Maryknoll had one, too. And then Chuo Gakuen.

All you have to do is carry a bugle."" So I started blowing the bugle and kept that up, and (...) I became a member of the junior orchestra. My parents bought me a cornet, (...) and that's what I had when I went to Manzanar. So that's the drum and bugle corps (beginners).",Life after removal and during the incarceration

2786,"Yeah, the railroad company gave its employees special passes. It didn't cost them anything except the tickets to issue them and they would get on the train to go down San Diego, and so we got an annual pass to go down to San Diego. That was our vacation for the year. The whole family got to get on board. It didn't cost the railroad much except the tickets they printed because they rode, boarded the train and just sat on the train and went all the way to San Diego, got off, then we had to pay for going into the zoo and all. And after that was through we'd get back on the train and come home. So that was one of the, I guess, one of the benefits of working for the railroad, get free rides to San Diego.

2791,"Well, I guess things were pretty good at that time, and he wanted something more permanent. And the laws were that if you were born here and turned twenty-one you could then purchase land, so he was looking around and found something close by, only three blocks away, at 2617 East 3rd Street in Boyle Heights. And he purchased it under her name. And so it was a two story house with one, two, three, four, five bedrooms and two bath and a deep lot. And he purchased it and we were very close to Roosevelt High School on 3rd Street, between Mott and Fickett Street, and it was handy for us because I, I could walk to First Street school, walk to Hollenbeck, walk to Roosevelt.

And also he had ice, packed ice with fish, and so when he came around my mother would come out and look at what he had, not only in fruits and vegetables, but more the fish. Because she didn't drive, she didn't walk far, and it was very convenient that he came by. So she bought whatever (fish he had) and she packed it in the icebox for our food for dinner.

And Ray was a little older, but he was a little awkward and we were tenth graders, but we were very active in sports with a bunch of Jewish kids. And so after hours as we were growing up, since we were about the same size as some of the Jewish kids, they invited us to play at the Michigan (Soto), Michigan gymnasium. So Ray and I would walk into this Jewish gymnasium past the Jewish mothers who would look at us, and they knew we weren't Jewish, but it didn't bother them, (afterwards) they got used to seeing us.

And then a group that we were playing adopted the name of the street, Wabash, and then the name Saxons, so they used that in some of the activities and that kind of stuck to the teams that we played with. It wasn't every specific team, but if we were gonna go play, says the Wabash Saxons are having a meet or something, and we'd go to the gymnasium to go play.

I'd go to the Evergreen Baptist Church and then go home, but after that... our relationship with the Jewish kids had also developed a group that had the corner of First and (Soto Street) to sell newspapers. And so Larry Anisman and another fellow, Jewish kids, had the corner. They knew the person who was distributing the newspapers, and he'd come by and distribute so many Examiner, Daily News, which were the evening papers, and there was the four o'clock, the five o'clock or whatever newspapers. Each one had the results of the horse races. The people who were buying the afternoon newspapers were all interested in the horse race result, and so after school we would run down to First and (Soto intersection), each of the corners we'd have to have people assigned to it. So the Jewish boys took the bus (route), busses on First and (...) Soto Street. I was assigned the street car, the P-car going to Boyle Heights at the First and Soto. And Ray was there, too. Anyway, as the newspapers came out at different hours, the people that were going home that bought the newspapers wanted certain times, the (horse) race results, so we were very busy trying to make money. And the Jewish kids were the guys that had the connections. Japanese kids didn't have any. So I think we, I told you the, later on, the war progressed. The distributor of the newspapers was a Filipino, and then when the results came out of the war breaking out, then there was a lot of animosity towards Japanese. And then the announcements about what was happening in the war didn't help. So later on this Filipino distributor says, ""You Japanese boys, you can't work anymore."" So we lost our jobs.

So they went up there and went through all the hospital looking for JACL leaders. They couldn't find them. They came out. They thought that maybe he was being held in protective custody in the jail, but the jail was in the front of the camp, so they came down -- they had hachimakis on, the Kibeis -- and they were making... they must've been drinking something, shochu or something.

2867,"Louis Frizzell was a recent graduate of UCLA music school. He was born in Shafter, California. We found that out afterwards. We come back and met his father up at Shafter, California. It's a town way up north. And his major at UCLA was music, and he came to us in Manzanar as a teacher to take over the music department. And he had a special talent. He was a single man. He was, had some physical problem. I don't know if it was a heart or whatever, but he couldn't join the armed forces. But he was tremendous in terms of musical talent. While he was at UCLA in music he wrote a musical about college life and what we did is, I think in about the third year of camp life, we experienced him getting involved in more music and drama, orchestra. At first, as the classes convened, he got them organized and got them involved in singing (in) choral groups. So he formed a lot of choral groups, different classes, and had different kinds of musicals that he created for different seasons. So he got them involved in Christmas, singing messiahs and Japanese, I don't know, Christmas songs. And he formed an orchestra and got them to play different kinds of seasonal tunes. Christmas time, he got them to play the ""Toy Trumpet,"" and other seasonal performances. He got the choral group to sing (""America""), but it was about the history of the United States, in choral form, and it started off [sings] ""In 1776 the sky was red and thunder rumbling overhead, and bad King George couldn't sleep in his bed 'cause on that fateful morn, oh, Uncle Sam was born."" And he goes through this whole operetta and the whole choir sings it with different parts, and so he was very innovative, he even wrote a operetta while he was at the UCLA and got the students to perform it (in Manzanar). It was about college life and had different parts. And I wasn't part of that group. For some reason I think I had left to got to work up in Utah to make some money for college. But they performed this musical while I was gone. It was very popular and talked about college life and the people that were in class and they (...) had a problem. They wanted to do something but couldn't raise money, and then one of the graduates who was an actress and a performer, (she) comes and then they had a fundraiser and everybody participated, and they raised the money and they were successful. And the choir and the people that played the different parts, all Niseis, they put it on and did a wonderful job. And he got them excited. He got them involved. He got them to sing songs from different parts, from Australia, so he got them informed (and educated). Christmas songs, he got the orchestra to play seasonal songs. The play he wrote, he got them to also play other parts of drama, drama class. So he got them really going, and I don't think that the Niseis that were in our class would've ever been involved in any of these things had they stayed at the schools they were in, because they were too timid, or kind of reserved kind of people, not the outgoing like the Jewish kids or other kids, but they were exposed to Mr. Frizzell, who used their talents and brought it out. And I thought he did a whale of a job of keeping us involved (and participating).",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2868,"Yeah, I was involved because I was playing the trumpet. We used to play, Christmas time, the ""Toy Trumpet."" I played the solo for that. For band, I played the solo for that. And then when we had our graduation we had three trumpet players get up there, and before the program started, dum da da dum, da da da da da da da, and then another scale up, and they had three trumpets playing different notes, but we had the fanfare for the opening ceremony. And he did so much to bring lifestyle and campstyle for our school. He was an amazing person. He also discovered special talents of our students, like Mary Kageyama, and he got her to sing in her style. And he thought so much of her that he wanted her to go to New York -- I think I might've said that before -- to perform in the musicals in New York. But at that time everybody said that that would be inappropriate because there was too much racial discrimination, and so she didn't go. But if you recall, even recently now, there was an article about Jack Su, Jack Suzuki, who changed his name to get by. But she could've maybe done that, but she didn't. But within our circle she's been singing, and amazingly her whole family sings, and so her son-in-law leads an orchestra, her daughter sings, their two sons sing, and she continues singing. We have this book signing of my book. I wrote memoirs for my kids, and you helped me, and then they said, ""Well, why don't, why don't you print the book?""

2901,"Well that was all a new experience for us. I mean, the three of us from our class that went out, Reggie Shikami and Seigo Yoshinaga and I, we were in the same tent, three guys in a tent. None of us had any kind of farm experience. The only incentive was that it was work and that they would pay you, and so it was not a matter of experience. It's a matter of tryin' to go out there and make some money. And they didn't tell us what kind of work we're gonna do, except farm work, so as we were assigned to go out and work we found out what the job was and we applied ourselves. So it's a whole new experience for all of us. Some people worked on a farm. Some people worked in the plants, like there was one experience where we worked for a company that canned peas, and they put them in cans and then cooked them and brought them out, and you had to take it out of the, I think a big metal basket that they had taken in and cooked them, and it had to come out of the cooker and had to take them out and then stack them. And stackin' em', you had to have gloves because it was still hot. But we did that kind of job. There were others that worked at making ketchup. The tomatoes would come down the row and you would have to take the ones that were not so good or not tomatoes or leaves and try to clear the belt of irregulars and the ones that wouldn't be applicable to the kitchen. And you learn on the job what was required. We had to clean the stalls of animals' refuse, and we had to mow the hay. We had to work in lining up the rows of hay. You have to get the hay that's cut and line it up in rows so that the machine can come down and pick up the hay and bale it. And then after it's baled, then you have to take the baled hay and put them on trucks and then put them in the barn. So we learned how to do each phase as they taught us, and I tell you, we came out very physically strong after the work we did on the farm. It was hard work. (...) For tomato season, what you have to do is, as the tomato plants grow, you have to kinda prune them to get the ones that aren't doing so well and take them off the vine because they take the same nourishment that the other ones are provided, and you need the nourishments for the good ones, so they become good solid tomatoes. So the preliminary, I guess, pickings are more or less ferret out or clean out the bad ones, and so we did that and from there on it's supposed to be good pickings. Well, you have bad luck and the frost came in. It froze all the tomatoes. Everything is dead. You learn that farming is not all that easy to do. The farmers that make money, they're lucky.

2921,"Well, when we left Fort Snelling, we had been stationed at, we had been ordered to go to Japan, so the whole troop went to Seattle and we went to the port quarters where we had to wait 'til the ship got in, and when we went there and reported I contracted an illness, and I got the mumps. So they sent me to the hospital. And it's an infectious disease, so they took me right away and put me in a hospital and had me in restrictive quarters. Nobody else could come in the area. It's contagious. I don't know what it was all about, and they says, ""You can't leave your bed."" They said, ""You're restricted right here."" I says, ""But I have to go."" Said, ""You do it in bed."" I said, ""I can't do it in bed."" He says, ""You have to do it in bed."" [Laughs] So that was quite an experience. Once you do it, that, that's it.

2923,"When we were shipped out to go to Japan I was supposed to be stationed in Tokyo with the housing for civilians that were coming over to help in trying to get the Japanese government going again, but at the last minute, I came home one night and there were orders on my bed saying I was ordered to go to the Philippines to the war crimes, and so I had to wake up my buddy to have him take care of all the things that I had to ship home and so that I could report in the morning to go to the airport, to go to the Philippines for the war crimes tribunal. (...) The army is not, not very helpful in terms of giving you much time to go from one place to another. It was overnight. I came home, orders (were) on the bed to report in the morning to ship out to the Philippines. That's it. So you have how many hours to take care of everything you had to do.

2925,"Well, we looked like the enemy. There's no guarantee that Filipino civilians would not attack us. Even if we had U.S. uniforms on, the Filipino people really suffered and were maltreated by the Japanese soldiers, so they, they were really mad at the Japanese and there's no guarantee that anybody would, would take care of us, other than ourselves. A Filipino could attack us at any time. So we were in another compound. Our quarters were behind barbed wires again, and we were protected by the Filipino soldiers from the Filipino (army). So there I was again, behind barbed wires, and all during the time we were in the Philippines, we were, all the Niseis were in one unit working for the war crimes (...). I just saw another friend of mine had passed away. Because most of my (aging) classmates, a number of them have already passed away. I guess I'm one of the holdovers.

2929,"Well, the children had no homes. In the whole of Manila there were few buildings that were standing. The old city hall was bombed out; everything was bombed out. Very few homes standing. People were homeless and family didn't exist. All the kids were wild. They were roamin' around and wanted to find food, so the kids would come under the barbed wire at night and steal everything they could find from us. We had to post guard every night. We'd catch the kids and take them to police. They would register them and they had no place to put them. They'd come back the next night. So we had to post guard every night. We got to know the kids and we tried to help them, but there was no, no way to fully take care of them, so the police knew them well and we knew them well and we did what we could, but we couldn't, we couldn't keep (them fed and clothed).",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2930,So what was your assignment as part of the Manila war crimes tribunal? What were your responsibilities there?,Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2931,"Our responsibilities were more to work in translation. There were (Japanese soldier) prisoners that had surrendered. The war had ended, but there were a lot of soldiers that were out in the jungles and lost their company, lost their fighting unit. They were loners. They didn't know where to go. Their unit was lost. And as they gave up and reported, our duty was to process and to find out if they were any of the ones that had committed war crimes against the Filipinos, and if they were cleared of any atrocities, then they were processed so that they could return home. Those that had committed atrocities were imprisoned and had to wait hearings for the war crimes. So that was part of our duties, and also translating (statements of) those that were found to have been responsible for some atrocities, we had to convert their testimony in Japanese to English, as the court was conducted all in English. So that was part of our work in doing the translation. And then the people above us would then have to read our work and make any corrections before it was submitted to the court. For us, our work was more or less to clear people of any atrocities, get them to a point where they would be free to go home. And the problem was there was no quick way to do that. It's a process of clearing them, taking their testimony, making sure that they weren't responsible for atrocities, and there was, hate to say it, but there was a lot of atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers. They became animals just like they do in every war. A lot of them that were in the Philippines were from Kyushu, and that's where my folks came from, Kyushu. So they were, came from Kumamoto and, and Fukuoka, and they wanted to get home. And so once they were cleared they were used as help for us in the camps. They worked in the kitchens and kept the bathrooms and everything clean, the grounds clean. They had no money, so us GIs were mostly (Niseis), felt sorry for them. So I didn't smoke and I didn't drink so I would take my allotment and I would a buy beer and cigarettes and take them over and give it to the prisoners because they had nothing, had nothing at all. And they put on a show for us as a kind of thank you, before they left for home. We got to know each other and they got to know about Japanese Americans. I think a relationship was established at that time.",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2932,"So when your time was up you returned to Tokyo and then you were, you found out you weren't assigned a table of organization. Why is this so important?",Returning of Japanese American after WWII
2933,"Well, when we were assigned to the Philippines our orders said that we were assigned to the (...) military police (unit). However, that military police was not the ones that issued us our monthly checks. In order to get a raise in rank you had to be in a table of order, which means you had to be assigned to a group that we would report your name at your (position) every month, that you're entitled to certain benefits, and we weren't under that table of order. And it's the mistake of the Military Intelligence Service group that assigned us from Tokyo to Manila for not having set that up. And so we never got a raise in rank. We were a private from the time we left Minneapolis. They didn't raise our rank at all, and yet we were going home, they say, ""Would you like to sign up for two years?"" I says what for? I mean, ""If we did what would, what would happen? We would wind up the same way?"" ""Oh no, we'll make you a lieutenant."" I says, ""Why aren't we a lieutenant now? What happened?"" And that's my peeve and my complaint against the MIS: they didn't take care of us. Not at all. But anyway, that's what you call a goof.

So she lived for free and she rented the place out. She would keep the rent, but she would look after the property and that's all my parents were worried about, someone to live there and make sure the property was maintained.

And Monday when I went down to USC, I filled out all the forms and then found out that I could register for the coming semester for the evening program. The day program was (full). And I (applied for the night program). I was happy that each night I had a different course, three units, and so I had fifteen units during the week. I was able to attend school by street car. I didn't have a car. And I could study while I was riding on the street car, which was a benefit.

And Al Silverman was one of the Jewish persons I got to know, and he had a job with a Jewish firm doing bookkeeping, and somehow we made contact. I was in touch with these people from New York. I got to know the group. There were three fellows from, that were together, one in accounting, one in marketing and I think two, one in engineering. But Al Silverman was in accounting, and so he had a part time job with Mr. Reginald Wilson. He told me about it, and he says that he was gonna leave Mr. Wilson's firm to work at another firm and if I wanted to take over his job, so he introduced me to Mr. Wilson, who had never dealt with a Japanese American but who was looking for someone to fill in the job, so he agreed to let me do the accounting that Al Silverman was doing. He was basically doing bookkeeping work for various doctors, professional doctors of the Beverly Hills area, so I substituted for him and went to work for these various doctors to keep their books current. And when I did that I was doing bookkeeping work for several of his former clients and then got to help them out in the office as well, and so he had clients for the income tax that were pretty well-known people in the acting field.

They're trying to improve their lot by taking these classes, and I understood what their problem was, and so the day I took over the class from this party who, father died, I walked in and I was younger than most of the people that were students. And I just didn't know how to introduce myself, but I figured, well... so I went up to the board and wrote my name in Japanese, Ka-ji. And while I was doing that people started sitting down and then looking at the board and wondering what was happening, so after I finished writing it I introduced myself. I says, ""I'm your new instructor here. This is my name in Japanese,"" I says, ""but I just want to let you know what it represents so that you have a better feeling for the class."" I says, ""This is 'ka,' which means in Japanese, 'together,' that means not alone, but together. And 'ji"" means osameru, is to learn, to govern, and so to me, this 'Kaji' can be interpreted as Mr. Democracy, together we learn."" And everybody laughed. I says, ""That's the spirit. We come here and we come here to learn, and I'm here to help you as much as possible, so if you have anything on your mind,"" I says, ""don't hesitate to ask."" And so the class took off, and I says, ""And one more thing that I would like to propose to you."" I says, ""You're all working people and I know that after you work and come here, you're serious that you want to learn. I'm serious. I want you to learn."" I says, ""Let's make a deal."" I says, ""I would like for you to listen to my lesson and then work on it while you're in class, not take it home and do homework."" I says, ""I want you to do your homework while you're here, and then when you leave here you can go home and sleep and rest."" And I says, ""Anybody against that?"" Everybody's for it. So that's the formula I proposed to them, and it worked out fine. It did work. I got their attention. I got their attention, and (if) they had any questions, they asked their questions, they got it off their mind. And they did their homework, and if they didn't finish, at least they were almost through. So I kind of varied the subject matter so that it was more, I think, palatable for them and also saved them a lot of time.
